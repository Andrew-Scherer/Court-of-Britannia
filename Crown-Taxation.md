# 👑 Crown Taxation & Revenue

**How the Crown Generates Income**

---

## Who Can the Crown Tax?

The Crown may assess taxes only on entities that fall within its jurisdiction. Taxation presumes recognition of authority.

### Taxable Entities

- **Citizens of Britain:** Individuals who have accepted residency and civic protection are subject to taxation.
- **Crown-Aligned Guilds:** Guilds operating within city walls or holding Crown-recognized property are taxable.
- **Vassal Entities:** Factions or guilds that have pledged fealty or accepted Crown authority may be taxed by agreement.

### Non-Taxable Entities

- **Neutral Factions:** Entities that have made no compact with the Crown are not taxable.
- **Rebel Factions:** Groups in open defiance of the Crown are not taxable—they are targets for seizure, not taxation.

> **The Distinction:**
>
> Taxation requires acknowledgment of authority. Seizure does not. The Crown may still seize from non-taxable entities under decree, but this is an act of force, not fiscal policy.

## Two Types of Crown Taxation

The Crown's tax system operates through two mechanically distinct categories. Each applies to different types of transactions and produces different economic effects.

### A. Player Trade Tax (Redistributive)

This tax applies to **player-to-player transactions** — trade conducted through vendors, player-owned shops, and direct sales.

**Mechanical Operation:**

- Tax is deducted from the seller's proceeds
- Buyer always pays the listed price
- The city receives a percentage of the sale
- Final gold deposited to seller = sale price minus tax

**Economic EffEffects:**

- Prices remain stable — buyers face no surprise costs
- Merchants absorb revenue loss directly
- High tax rates create incentive to relocate trade
- External markets (cities with lower taxes) become competitive alternatives
- Black markets and informal trade emerge naturally under pressure

This tax mechanism preserves price certainty while placing economic pressure on sellers. That pressure translates into political behavior: lobbying, relocation threats, support for rival claimants, or public unrest.

> **Canon Statement:** "Player trade is political. Gold sinks are fiscal."

### B. NPC & System Fees (Extractive)

This tax applies to **NPC goods, services, and fees** — purchases from system vendors, crafting material vendors, repair costs, and similar gold sinks.

**Mechanical Operation:**

- Tax is added to the final price
- Buyer pays base price plus tax
- The city captures revenue before gold exits the economy
- No seller or merchant is affected

**Economic Effects:**

- Cost of living rises or falls with tax rates
- No market distortion — NPC prices are constants, not negotiations
- Primary lever for emergency revenue during fiscal crisis
- Affects all citizens equally, regardless of trade activity

This tax mechanism functions as the treasury's emergency reserve. It extracts revenue from unavoidable transactions without disrupting player-driven markets.

## Who Sets Crown Tax Policy

Tax policy is shaped through a structured process involving proposal, review, and authorization. Authority is divided between fiscal forecasting and executive decision.

### Master of the Treasury

**Authority:**

- Proposes tax rate changes
- Issues fiscal forecasts and warnings
- Provides visibility into revenue flows and treasury balance

**Explicit Non-Authority:**

- Cannot collect taxes manually
- Cannot grant exemptions or adjust rates unilaterally
- Cannot override Crown decisions

### King / Acting Regent

**Authority:**

- May approve tax proposals
- May reject tax proposals
- May override proposals with alternative policy
- Bears full political responsibility for outcomes

### The Proposal System

Tax changes follow a formal proposal and ratification process:

1. The Master of the Treasury submits a tax proposal to the Tax Ledger
2. A 24-hour window begins
3. The Crown may approve, reject, or modify the proposal during this window
4. If no action is taken within 24 hours, **the proposal takes effect automatically**

Silence equals consent. Inaction is recorded as tacit approval. The Crown's responsibility is not limited to explicit decisions — it includes decisions made by default.

## Automatic Collection & Logging

Tax collection is entirely automatic. No player initiates collection. No enforcement role is required. No manual auditing occurs.

**How Collection Works:**

- Every taxable transaction triggers automatic calculation
- Tax is applied at the moment of sale or purchase
- Revenue flows immediately into the city treasury
- No delay, no approval, no enforcement action required

**The Tax Ledger:**

Every tax-related event is logged automatically. The Tax Ledger records:

- Current tax rates for all categories
- Daily revenue inflow by source
- Treasury balance at end of day
- All policy changes with timestamps and authorship
- Crown action or inaction on proposals

The ledger is publicly accessible. Citizens, merchants, and officials may consult it at any time. Political actors use it to construct fiscal narratives.

## Treasury Flow

The city treasury is the central repository for all collected revenue and the source of all fiscal obligations. Revenue flows in automatically. Obligations flow out on schedule.

### Inflow

- **Player Trade Taxes:** Percentage of player-to-player sales
- **NPC & System Fees:** Premium added to system purchases
- **Property Transaction Taxes:** Revenue from land sales and transfers
- **Fines and Bounties:** Payments from justice system enforcement

### Outflow

- **Indexed Wages:** Daily salary payments to all seated roles
- **Bounty Payouts:** Rewards for arrests and enforcement actions
- **Other Governance Costs:** System expenses tied to city operations

When inflow exceeds outflow, the treasury accumulates surplus. When outflow exceeds inflow, the treasury draws down reserves. When reserves are depleted, salary payments are reduced or suspended.

## Economic Consequences (Not Controls)

Tax policy produces economic effects. These effects emerge from player behavior, not system enforcement. The tax system does not dictate outcomes — it creates conditions.

**Observable Outcomes of Tax Policy:**

- **Cost of living rises or falls:** NPC tax adjustments change the baseline expense of daily activity
- **Trade shifts location:** Merchants relocate to cities with lower player trade taxes
- **Merchant behavior changes:** Sellers lobby for rate reductions, fund rival claimants, or withhold goods
- **Black markets emerge:** Informal trade outside official channels gains appeal under high tax pressure
- **External trade increases:** Citizens travel to neighboring cities for purchases

These are not instructions. They are patterns that emerge when economic pressure meets political structure. Players choose how to respond. The system records the result.

## When Crown Taxation Fails

The tax system does not protect leadership from poor decisions. It does not cap rates at "reasonable" levels. It does not issue warnings beyond what the Master of the Treasury chooses to provide.

**How Excessive Crown Taxation Manifests:**

1. Tax rates rise beyond sustainable thresholds
2. Trade activity declines as merchants relocate or cease operations
3. Daily revenue decreases despite higher rates
4. Treasury shortfalls appear in the Tax Ledger
5. Wage payments are reduced or suspended
6. Political fallout intensifies — protests, rival claimants, civil unrest

**System Behavior:**

- The Master of the Treasury may issue warnings and forecasts
- The Crown absorbs political blame for outcomes
- No automatic rollback occurs
- No safety net prevents insolvency
- The Tax Ledger records every decision and non-decision

Failure is not prevented. Failure is documented.
