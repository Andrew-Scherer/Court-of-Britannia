**Legal Authority and Judicial Oversight**

## Role Overview

| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Position | Magistrate |
| Number of Positions | [TBD] |
| Appointed By | The King |
| Can Appoint | [TBD] |
| Reports To | The King |
| Function | Interpret law, adjudicate disputes, review arrests, issue sentences |

## What the Magistrate Does

The Magistrate serves as legal authority and judicial check on Crown power. They interpret law, adjudicate trials, review guard conduct, and issue sentences including death. The Magistrate provides an alternate voice of authority—law as distinct from force.

## Core Responsibilities

### Legal Review
- Review arrests for lawfulness
- Declare arrests unlawful when lacking legal basis
- Challenge Crown decrees that violate established law
- Provide legal interpretation on contested matters

### Judicial Authority
- Conduct trials for accused criminals
- Issue sentences: jail time, exile, execution, fines
- Grant or deny pardons and commutations (subject to Crown authority)
- Rule on property disputes and civil matters

### Oversight
- Investigate guard misconduct
- Review custody deaths and use of force
- Audit Coroner findings and determine legal accountability
- Declare regimes or actions illegitimate (political, not mechanical)

## Relationship to Other Authorities

### The Crown
The Magistrate serves at the King's pleasure but acts independently in judicial matters. The King appoints and may dismiss the Magistrate, but cannot override legal rulings without political cost.

### The Marshal of the Guard
The Magistrate reviews guard arrests and use of force. When the Marshal and Magistrate disagree, guards face political choices between law and force.

### The Warden
Peer relationship. The Warden manages custody; the Magistrate rules on legality and sentencing. Neither commands the other.

### The Coroner
The Coroner provides forensic evidence; the Magistrate adjudicates based on that evidence. Magistrates rely on Coroner findings but make independent legal judgments.

### The Executioner
The Magistrate sentences; the Executioner performs. The Executioner acts on Magistrate sentences but serves the Crown, not the Magistrate.

## Limits and Constraints

### What the Magistrate Cannot Do
- ❌ Command guards directly (that authority belongs to the Marshal)
- ❌ Execute prisoners personally (only the Executioner may perform executions)
- ❌ Override Crown decrees mechanically (Magistrate challenges create political cost, not mechanical blocks)
- ❌ Remove the King (only death, abdication, or coup can vacate the throne)

### Political vs Mechanical Authority
The Magistrate's power is **political, not mechanical**. A Magistrate can declare an arrest unlawful, but guards may still enforce it. A Magistrate can challenge a seizure, but the Crown may override. The Magistrate makes abuse **politically expensive**, not impossible.

## Why Play This Role?

The Magistrate is for players who want:
- **Legal authority** — Interpret and apply law
- **Judicial power** — Decide guilt, sentencing, and accountability
- **Political independence** — Challenge Crown and Marshal actions through legal authority
- **Oversight** — Review guard conduct and custody practices
- **Moral weight** — Make life-and-death decisions through due process

**This is one of the most powerful positions for creating legitimacy or exposing its absence.**

## Summary

- The Magistrate provides legal authority distinct from force
- Appointed by the King; acts independently in judicial matters
- Reviews arrests, conducts trials, issues sentences including death
- Challenges to Crown or Marshal create political cost, not mechanical blocks
- Relies on Coroner evidence and Warden custody records
- Authority over sentencing but not execution (Executioner role) or mercy (Crown prerogative)
- During succession crises, Magistrate declarations of legitimacy carry significant political weight
