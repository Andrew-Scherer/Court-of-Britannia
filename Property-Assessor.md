# 📊 Property Assessor

**Determining What Is Owed Without Enforcement Authority**

---

> *Assessment creates accountability. Collection requires coordination.*

The Property Assessor determines property tax obligations for landowners, guilds, and factions throughout Britain. This role identifies *how much is owed* but cannot collect, enforce, or issue decrees.

---

## Core Responsibilities

The Property Assessor:

- **Assesses property taxes** on land, buildings, and holdings
- **Records all assessments** in the public Tax Ledger
- **Updates assessments** when property changes hands or is improved/expanded
- **Provides transparency** into how taxes are calculated
- **Answers inquiries** about property tax obligations

---

## Powers

### What Property Assessors Can Do

- Calculate tax obligations based on property type, size, and location
- Record assessments publicly in the Tax Ledger
- Update assessments when ownership transfers or improvements occur
- Provide detailed breakdowns of how taxes are calculated
- Maintain historical records of property tax assessments

---

## Limits

### What Property Assessors Cannot Do

- ❌ **Cannot collect taxes** — Collection is automated for player trade; property taxes accrue as debt
- ❌ **Cannot enforce payment** — Enforcement requires Crown decree and guard participation
- ❌ **Cannot seize assets** — No authority to take property or gold
- ❌ **Cannot issue decrees** — Only the Crown can authorize enforcement
- ❌ **Cannot serve notices** — That authority belongs to the Diplomatic Corps
- ❌ **Cannot set tax rates** — Rates are determined by Crown policy and Master of Treasury proposals

---

## The Assessment Process

1. **Property Identified** — New construction, transfer, or periodic review
2. **Assessment Calculated** — Based on property type, size, improvements, location
3. **Recorded in Tax Ledger** — Public record with timestamp and assessor name
4. **Notice to Owner** — Property owner is informed of assessment
5. **Debt Accrues** — If unpaid, debt is recorded and may trigger enforcement

The Property Assessor's work creates the **initial debt record**. From there:

- The **Diplomatic Corps** serves formal notice
- The **Crown** issues decrees if payment is refused
- **Guards** enforce seizure if authorized
- The **Magistrate** may review legality

---

## Appointment & Dismissal

**Appointed By:** The King or Regent

**Term:** At the Crown's pleasure

**Removal:** The King or Regent may dismiss at any time

---

## Why This Role Matters

### Political Significance

The Property Assessor occupies a critical position in economic governance:

- **Assessments are public** — All calculations are visible and contestable
- **Errors create conflict** — Incorrect assessments undermine Crown legitimacy
- **Accuracy builds trust** — Fair assessments strengthen Crown authority
- **Targets begin here** — Every seizure and lien begins with an assessment

A skilled Property Assessor strengthens the Crown's economic position. A corrupt or incompetent Property Assessor creates endless disputes.

### Economic Impact

Property taxes are one of Britain's primary revenue sources. The Property Assessor determines:

- How much guilds owe for their halls
- How much noble houses owe for their estates
- How much factions owe for their territorial holdings
- How much individuals owe for their properties

These assessments shape guild survival, faction power, and Crown revenue.

## Integration with Other Systems

### Tax Ledger

All assessments are recorded in the Tax Ledger with:

- Property identifier (location and type)
- Owner (guild, faction, or individual)
- Assessment amount
- Assessor name
- Timestamp
- Calculation basis (how the assessment was determined)

The Tax Ledger is public and viewable by all, creating transparency and accountability.

### Crown Taxation System

Property assessments feed into the broader taxation system:

- **Player trade taxes** — Automated, set by Crown policy
- **Property taxes** — Assessed by Property Assessor, accrued as debt
- **Vendor taxes** — Automated based on Crown rates
- **Settlement taxes** — Apply to guild-controlled territories

→ See: [[Crown Taxation|Crown-Taxation]] for complete system details

### Enforcement Chain

The Property Assessor is the first link in the enforcement chain:

1. **Property Assessor** — Determines what is owed
2. **Tax Ledger** — Records the debt publicly
3. **Diplomatic Corps** — Serves notice and coordinates enforcement
4. **Crown** — Issues decrees authorizing action
5. **Guards** — Execute enforcement (if they agree)
6. **Magistrate** — Reviews legality (if challenged)

→ See: [[Seizure, Enforcement & Insolvency|Seizure-Enforcement]] for enforcement mechanics

## Common Questions

### Q: Can a Property Assessor reduce someone's taxes?

**A:** No. Assessors apply Crown policy and established rates. They cannot grant exemptions or adjust assessments based on favoritism. All assessments must be calculated consistently.

### Q: What happens if someone disputes an assessment?

**A:** The Property Assessor must provide the calculation methodology. If the dispute continues, the Magistrate may review the assessment. The Crown may adjust rates, but assessments are binding unless overturned.

### Q: Can property owners see how their taxes were calculated?

**A:** Yes. All assessments in the Tax Ledger include calculation basis. Transparency is mandatory.

### Q: What if a property owner refuses to pay?

**A:** The Property Assessor records the debt. Enforcement is handled by the Diplomatic Corps, Crown decree, and Guards. The Assessor has no enforcement authority.

### Q: How often are properties re-assessed?

**A:** Assessments occur when:
- Property is newly constructed
- Property changes hands (sale, inheritance, seizure)
- Property is improved (expansions, upgrades)
- Crown policy changes tax rates
- Periodic reviews (timing set by Crown policy)
