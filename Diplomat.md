|---|---|
| Position | Diplomat |

| Reports To | Envoys and High Emissary |

## What Diplomats Do

Diplomats conduct the daily work of Britain's external presence. They deliver messages and proclamations, observe and report on faction activities, attend faction events as Britain's representatives, and create the initial contact points between Britain and factions.

Diplomats operate in spaces where Guards have no authority and Military presence would escalate. They are the visible face of Britain in faction territories, relying on diplomatic protection and Britain's reputation to stay safe.


> They are not powerful. They are dangerous to touch.


## Core Duties


### Proclamation Delivery


- **Deliver official messages** — Carry Britain's position to faction territories
- **Recognition notices** — Inform factions of status changes (Recognized, Tolerated, Outlawed)
- **Demands and warnings** — Communicate Britain's expectations and consequences
- **Ultimatums** — Deliver final notices before Britain acts


### Witnessing and Recording


- **Witness faction responses** — Record acceptance, refusal, or defiance
- **Document fealty oaths** — Create binding records of sworn allegiance
- **Observe faction activities** — Report on events, meetings, and movements
- **Record treaty violations** — Document breaches of agreements


### Tax Enforcement Notices

As members of the diplomatic corps, Diplomats may:


- **Serve formal notice of tax debt** to guilds and factions
- **Record responses** — Acknowledgment, payment, refusal, or silence
- **Coordinate with Guards** for enforcement when debts remain unpaid
- **Maintain public records** of all notices and outcomes


### Intelligence Gathering


- **Observe faction capabilities** — Report on resources, numbers, and readiness
- **Identify alliances** — Track who is allied with whom
- **Report internal disputes** — Note succession crises and factional splits
- **Assess threats** — Warn Britain of emerging dangers


## Diplomatic Protection

All Diplomats operate under diplomatic protection—a political norm that makes harming them an attack on Britain itself.


> **❗ Note**


### Why Protection Exists


- Britain is powerful enough to retaliate
- Factions value future negotiations
- Communication channels remaining open benefits all parties
- Attacking diplomats creates casus belli


### When Protection Breaks Down


- Britain is weak or distracted
- The faction sees no value in future dialogue
- The diplomat is caught spying or inciting rebellion
- During total war, when norms collapse

**Attacking a Diplomat creates the same consequence as attacking the High Emissary or Envoy: casus belli.** Britain does not distinguish between ranks when diplomatic protection is violated—all three carry Britain's authority equally in the field.


## Operating in Faction Territories


### No Mechanical Authority

Diplomats have no enforcement powers in faction spaces:


- Cannot make arrests
- Cannot use force
- Cannot seize property
- Cannot command Guards or Military outside Britain

**Their authority is political, not mechanical.** Factions listen because Britain can retaliate if they don't—or they ignore diplomats when Britain cannot.


### Reliance on Presence and Witness

Diplomats create consequences through visibility:


- **"We delivered the warning"** — Removes "we didn't know" as a defense
- **"They refused publicly"** — Creates documented justification for escalation
- **"We witnessed the oath"** — Binds factions to their word
- **"They attacked a diplomat"** — Justifies Britain's response


## Relationship With Other Roles


### Envoys

Diplomats report to Envoys who:


- Assign specific missions and territories
- Provide direction on proclamations to deliver
- Receive intelligence reports from the field
- Appoint and dismiss Diplomats


### High Emissary

The High Emissary sets overall diplomatic strategy. While Diplomats rarely interact directly with the High Emissary, their work implements the High Emissary's vision for Britain's external relationships.


### Guards and Military

Diplomats coordinate with Guards and Military when:


- **Tax enforcement escalates** — Guards provide backing for seizures
- **Escort is needed** — Military protects diplomats traveling through hostile territories
- **Intelligence is critical** — Diplomats warn of imminent attacks

Tension arises when:


- Diplomats claim more time will resolve a crisis; Military sees delay as weakness
- Military action undermines ongoing diplomatic efforts
- Diplomats demand restraint; Military demands freedom of action


## Political Temptations and Risks


### Developing Faction Loyalties

Diplomats assigned to specific factions over time may develop loyalty to those factions over Britain:


- Personal relationships with faction leaders
- Respect for faction culture and values
- Belief that Britain's policy toward the faction is unjust
- Offers of better treatment from powerful factions


> **❗ Note**
> Unlike military coups, diplomatic defection operates through:
> - Selective reporting (suppressing unfavorable intelligence)
> - Delayed deliveries (buying factions time to prepare)
> - Sympathetic interpretation (presenting faction positions favorably)
> - Warning factions of Britain's intentions


### Intelligence Manipulation

Diplomats who suppress or fabricate intelligence can:


- Engineer crises by hiding warnings
- Blind Britain to faction threats
- Create false justifications for war
- Favor one claimant during succession crises

**By the time defection is obvious, Britain's external relationships have already shifted.**


## Succession Crises

When Britain's authority fragments, Diplomats face the same choice as Guards and Military: **Which claimant do we recognize?**

Diplomatic recognition in faction territories is constitutive—it creates external legitimacy:


- **If Diplomats recognize Claimant A** — Factions see A as Britain's legitimate ruler
- **If Diplomats recognize Claimant B** — Factions shift allegiance accordingly
- **If Diplomats split recognition** — Factions exploit the division; succession crisis prolongs


## Why Play This Role?

Diplomats are for players who want:


- **Access to faction territories** — Explore beyond Britain's walls
- **Intelligence networks** — Learn faction secrets and plans
- **Political leverage** — Influence conflicts before they begin
- **Diplomatic protection** — Make violence against you politically expensive
- **Entry to the diplomatic corps** — Path to becoming Envoy or High Emissary
- **Temptation** — The slow realization you could serve factions over the Crown

**This is the entry-level diplomatic role with significant autonomy and political impact.**


## Summary


- Diplomats deliver proclamations, witness responses, and gather intelligence in faction territories
- Appointed by Envoys; unlimited positions available
- Operate under diplomatic protection that makes violence against them an attack on Britain
- Have no mechanical authority; power operates through visibility and consequence
- Possess tax enforcement authority as part of the diplomatic corps
- Risk developing faction loyalties that conflict with Britain's interests
