# ⚖️ Warden of the Dungeons

**Custody is automatic. Pressure is optional.**

---


## Core Definition

The Warden of the Dungeons is a Crown-appointed observer and amplifier of custody.

The Warden is not required for arrests, releases, timers, sentencing, or execution eligibility. The Warden controls visibility, discomfort, and political cost. The Warden does not control outcomes.

Jail mechanics function fully without a Warden. The Warden does not keep the system running.


> **Note**
> **See:** [[Jail System|Jail]] for custody mechanics, timers, and auto-release rules


## What the Warden Is NOT

The Warden cannot:


- Block visits entirely
- Prevent auto-release
- Decide sentence length
- Override Magistrates or the Crown
- Be required for jail RP or custody resolution


> **❗ Note**


## Custody Condition Modifiers

The Warden may apply condition changes without affecting custody duration:


| Condition Type | Options |
|---|---|
| Confinement | Group vs individual holding |
| Restraint | Shackled vs unshackled |
| Visibility | Public holding vs quiet custody |
| Comfort | Restricted comfort (flavor only) |

These change how custody feels. They do not change how long it lasts.


## Visibility & Interest Flags

The Warden may apply flags to arrest records:


- High Concern
- Irregular Custody
- Politically Sensitive
- Death-Eligible Under Review

Effects:


- Alerts Magistrates
- Signals importance to the realm

No approval is required to apply these flags.


## Arrest Ledger Interaction

The Arrest Ledger automatically records name, time, custody class, and arresting guard. It is updated by guards and system events.

The Warden may:


- Append observational annotations
- Publish notes on conditions, deviations, or irregularities

The Warden cannot:


- Edit base records
- Erase entries

This parallels the Coroner updating the Public Death Ledger.


## Pattern Annotation Authority

The Warden may publish pattern statements:


- Repeated unresolved capital custody
- Repeated arrests by the same guard
- Systemic delays or deviations

These are not accusations. They are institutional memory. They create pressure without blocking play.


## Public Statements by Prisoners

Prisoners may attach their own statements to their arrest record. Only the prisoner may add statements to their own record. Statements do not alter custody mechanics.

This encourages jailed players to stay engaged. It shifts jail from waiting room to political record.


## Relationship to Other Offices


### The Crown

The Warden is appointed and removed solely by the King. The Warden serves at the King's pleasure.


> The Warden of the Dungeons is appointed and removed by the Crown. They serve at the King's pleasure — and carry the King's shame.


### Magistrate

Peer relationship, not hierarchical. The Magistrate rules on legality. The Warden records how law is experienced.


> The Magistrate rules on law. The Warden records how law is experienced.


### Guards

Guards control bodies. Wardens control memory. No command authority in either direction.


> The Guard controls bodies. The Warden controls memory.


## Absence Handling

Jail systems resolve fully without a Warden online. Auto-release occurs as defined in jail.html.

When a Warden returns, they may reconstruct events and publish discrepancies.

Absence creates silence — not blockage.


## Role Count

Recommended maximum: 2 Wardens.

Scarcity preserves tension. Too many Wardens bureaucratize custody.


## System Summary


> *A jailed character is not paused. They are exposed.*
