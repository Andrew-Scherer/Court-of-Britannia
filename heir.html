        <h1><span class="crown-emoji">👑</span> The Heir Presumptive</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">"Claim Without Authority — Blood Without Power"</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <strong>Core Principle:</strong> The Heir Presumptive holds <strong>legitimacy, claim, and blood right</strong> — but <strong>NO King powers</strong>. They are the <em>next in line</em>, not the ruler. The Crown transfers only at coronation.
        </div>

        <h2>📜 What Is an Heir?</h2>
        <p>An <strong>Heir</strong> is a player appointed by the King to be a <strong>designated successor</strong> to the throne. A King may name <strong>up to three heirs</strong>, ordered by precedence:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Heir:</strong> The favored successor — strongest legitimacy and first right to coronation</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Heir:</strong> The legitimate backup — inherits claim if Primary dies or is disqualified</li>
            <li><strong>Tertiary Heir:</strong> The last resort — ensures continuity even in catastrophic succession crises</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These appointments signal:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legitimacy:</strong> The King's official endorsement of these persons as next rulers</li>
            <li><strong>Ordered Precedence:</strong> Clear hierarchy of who has the strongest claim</li>
            <li><strong>Dynasty Survival:</strong> Multiple heirs protect against permadeath eliminating the line of succession</li>
            <li><strong>Future Authority:</strong> The promise of power — <em>after coronation</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p>However, being named Heir does <strong>not grant any King powers</strong>. While the King lives, no Heir has authority to rule Britannia. They are claimants, not rulers.</p>

        <h2>👑 Why Name Multiple Heirs?</h2>
        
        <p>In a world of <strong>permadeath</strong>, succession is never guaranteed. A King names multiple heirs for strategic reasons:</p>

        <h3>1. Insurance Against Permadeath</h3>
        <p>If the Primary Heir dies permanently (assassination, battle, accident), the dynasty doesn't collapse. The Secondary Heir immediately becomes the strongest claimant.</p>

        <h3>2. Continuity During Crisis</h3>
        <p>Multiple heirs ensure that even if two successors die, a third remains to stabilize the realm and prevent total power vacuum.</p>

        <h3>3. Political Balance</h3>
        <p>Naming heirs from different factions can <strong>balance competing powers</strong> and prevent any single faction from dominating succession.</p>

        <h3>4. Hedge Against Betrayal</h3>
        <p>If the Primary Heir proves disloyal, incompetent, or compromised, the King has alternatives without abandoning succession plans entirely.</p>

        <h3>5. Fear of Extinction</h3>
        <p>Kings who fear their dynasty will die with them often name multiple heirs to ensure <em>someone</em> carries their legacy forward.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>⚠️ The Cost of Multiple Heirs:</strong> While multiple heirs increase dynasty survival, they <strong>reduce succession certainty</strong>. More heirs means more potential conflict, contested claims, and political maneuvering during succession. Each additional heir is both protection and danger.
        </div>

        <h2>⚔️ When the King Dies</h2>
        <p>When a King dies, <strong>NO heir automatically becomes King</strong>. Succession is <em>not</em> automatic. Instead:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Crown becomes vacant</strong> — no one holds the Crown</li>
            <li><strong>All named heirs become eligible candidates</strong> — Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary heirs are all recognized claimants</li>
            <li><strong>Heir precedence determines claim strength</strong> — Primary has strongest claim, then Secondary, then Tertiary</li>
            <li>If a <strong>Regent exists, they govern in trust</strong> — holding delegated authority until coronation</li>
            <li>A <strong>coronation timer begins</strong> (3-7 days) — creating urgency to get crowned</li>
            <li><strong>Coronation resolves which heir (if any) is crowned</strong> — the first to coronation wins the Crown</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>⚠️ Critical:</strong> All heirs hold <strong>claim and legitimacy</strong>, but <strong>zero King powers</strong>. They cannot issue edicts, command guards, or enforce laws until crowned. They are <em>symbols</em> without authority. The Crown transfers <strong>only at coronation</strong>.
        </div>

        <h3>Heir Precedence: Who Has the Strongest Claim?</h3>
        <p>When multiple heirs exist, <strong>precedence determines claim strength</strong>:</p>

        <table class="comparison-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Heir Tier</th>
                <th>Claim Strength</th>
                <th>Political Position</th>
                <th>Succession Right</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Primary Heir</strong></td>
                <td>🥇 Strongest</td>
                <td>Favored successor — presumptive next ruler</td>
                <td>First right to coronation. Most legitimate claimant.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Secondary Heir</strong></td>
                <td>🥈 Strong</td>
                <td>Legitimate backup — waiting for Primary to fail</td>
                <td>If Primary dies or is disqualified, becomes strongest claimant.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Tertiary Heir</strong></td>
                <td>🥉 Recognized</td>
                <td>Last resort — insurance against total succession collapse</td>
                <td>If Primary and Secondary both die, becomes strongest claimant.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <div class="key-point">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Precedence is <em>not</em> a mechanical lock. It determines <strong>legitimacy and claim strength</strong>, but does not prevent any heir from racing to coronation. A Tertiary Heir who reaches coronation <em>first</em> can become King, even if the Primary Heir survives.
        </div>

        <h3>Succession Scenarios: What Happens to Each Heir?</h3>

        <p><strong>Scenario 1: All Three Heirs Survive</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>All three are eligible candidates with ordered precedence</li>
            <li>Primary Heir has strongest claim and political advantage</li>
            <li>Secondary and Tertiary may challenge, ally with Primary, or attempt their own coronation</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum succession tension</strong> — three legitimate claimants competing for the Crown</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Scenario 2: Primary Heir Dies</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Secondary Heir inherits strongest claim and becomes presumptive successor</li>
            <li>Tertiary Heir becomes the new backup heir</li>
            <li>Political landscape shifts — Secondary now has Primary's legitimacy</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Scenario 3: Primary and Secondary Both Die</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tertiary Heir becomes the <strong>sole named heir</strong> with strongest claim</li>
            <li>Dynasty survives catastrophic losses</li>
            <li>Tertiary's legitimacy is now undisputed among named heirs</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Scenario 4: All Three Heirs Die (Extinction Event)</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>No named heirs remain — <strong>total succession collapse</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Claimants</strong> (unofficial rivals) become the only path to succession</li>
            <li>Regent (if any) may seize the throne or civil war may erupt</li>
            <li>This is the nightmare scenario Kings name multiple heirs to prevent</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>⚠️ Permadeath Risk:</strong> In a permadeath environment, multiple heirs are not paranoia — they are <strong>dynasty insurance</strong>. Assassination, battle, and accident can eliminate any claimant. Three heirs mean three chances to preserve the line of succession.

        <h2>🛡️ What the Heir Presumptive Has</h2>
        
        <h3>✅ The Heir Holds:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strongest Claim:</strong> Official designation as next ruler</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimacy:</strong> Recognized by the previous King and (usually) the realm</li>
            <li><strong>Blood Right:</strong> Lineage-based or merit-based claim endorsed by the Crown</li>
            <li><strong>Symbolic Authority:</strong> Respect, deference, and political weight — but no enforcement power</li>
            <li><strong>First Right to Coronation:</strong> Priority access to <a href="becoming-king.html">the coronation process</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>❌ The Heir Does NOT Hold:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Crown:</strong> Only transfers at coronation</li>
            <li><strong>King Powers:</strong> Cannot issue laws, commands, or enforce authority</li>
            <li><strong>Guaranteed Succession:</strong> Must survive rivals, Regent, and Claimants to reach coronation</li>
            <li><strong>Regent Powers:</strong> If a Regent exists, they hold delegated King authority — not the Heir</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>⚖️ Heir vs. Regent: The Power Imbalance</h2>
        <p>When both an <strong>Heir</strong> and a <strong>Regent</strong> exist after the King's death, a dangerous power imbalance emerges:</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <strong>The Tension:</strong> The Heir has <em>legitimacy</em>. The Regent has <em>authority</em>. This creates political intrigue, alliance-building, and potential conflict as the Heir must navigate the Regent's power to reach coronation.
        </div>

        <p>See <a href="regent.html">The Regent</a> for details on Regent powers and limits.</p>

        <h2>🎯 The Heir's Challenges</h2>
        <p>An Heir Presumptive faces multiple threats on the path to coronation:</p>

        <h3>1. The Regent (Power Without Claim)</h3>
        <p>If a Regent exists, they may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Block coronation:</strong> Use their authority to delay or prevent the Heir from being crowned</li>
            <li><strong>Seize the throne:</strong> Self-crown before the Heir can act</li>
            <li><strong>Manipulate the Heir:</strong> Demand concessions, alliances, or loyalty in exchange for allowing coronation</li>
            <li><strong>Protect the Heir:</strong> (Rare) Genuinely serve as a steward until the Heir is crowned</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Claimants (Contested Blood)</h3>
        <p><strong>Claimants</strong> are rival players with <strong>contested or unofficial claims</strong> to the throne. They may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Challenge the Heir's legitimacy</li>
            <li>Raise armies to contest succession</li>
            <li>Race to reach coronation first</li>
            <li>Attempt to assassinate the Heir</li>
        </ul>

        <p>See <a href="claimant.html">Claimants</a> for more on how contested claims work.</p>

        <h3>3. The Coronation Timer (3-7 Days)</h3>
        <p>The longer the Heir waits, the more unstable the realm becomes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rivals gain ground:</strong> Claimants and Regent may seize momentum</li>
            <li><strong>Chaos spreads:</strong> Without a crowned King, the realm fractures</li>
            <li><strong>Accidents happen:</strong> Political assassination, ambush, imprisonment</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>⏳ Time Pressure:</strong> The coronation timer forces the Heir to act quickly — alliance-building, securing power, or racing to the coronation before rivals strike.
        </div>

        <h3>4. Assassination & Imprisonment</h3>
        <p>As the recognized successor, the Heir is a <strong>high-value target</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rivals may kill the Heir to clear their path to the throne</li>
            <li>A Regent may imprison the Heir to consolidate power</li>
            <li>Claimants may ambush the Heir before they reach coronation</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🏆 Paths to the Throne</h2>
        <p>The Heir Presumptive has several paths to claim the Crown:</p>

        <h3>1. Peaceful Succession (Best Case)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Regent (if any) steps aside or supports the Heir</li>
            <li>No serious Claimants contest the succession</li>
            <li>The Heir reaches coronation safely and becomes King/Queen</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="success">
            <strong>✅ Ideal Outcome:</strong> Smooth transfer of power. The Heir's legitimacy is undisputed, and they are crowned without conflict.
        </div>

        <h3>2. Political Negotiation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Heir must <strong>negotiate with the Regent</strong> for support or non-interference</li>
            <li>May involve promises, alliances, or concessions (e.g., "I'll keep you as Regent if you let me crown")</li>
            <li>The Heir leverages their legitimacy to build coalitions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Race to Coronation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Heir rushes to complete the coronation before the Regent or Claimants act</li>
            <li>High-risk, high-reward — success means becoming King, failure means losing power</li>
            <li>May involve bodyguards, secret routes, or surprise timing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Conflict & Uprising</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If the Regent blocks coronation, the Heir may <strong>rally support</strong> for an uprising</li>
            <li>Claimants may force the Heir into open conflict</li>
            <li>The Heir's legitimacy becomes a rallying cry for loyalists to overthrow the Regent</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🤝 Why a King Appoints Heirs</h2>
        <p>A wise King appoints heirs for strategic reasons:</p>

        <h3>1. Ensure Smooth Succession</h3>
        <p>Without named heirs, the King's death creates <strong>chaos</strong>. Unofficial Claimants may emerge, leading to civil war. Official heirs reduce uncertainty and provide legitimate succession paths.</p>

        <h3>2. Legitimize the Next Ruler</h3>
        <p>The King's endorsement grants heirs <strong>symbolic authority</strong> and makes them the presumptive next rulers in the eyes of the realm. This legitimacy is crucial during succession struggles.</p>

        <h3>3. Control Succession</h3>
        <p>Appointing heirs ensures the Crown passes to someone the King trusts — whether by blood, merit, or loyalty. Multiple heirs allow the King to balance different factions.</p>

        <h3>4. Prevent Power Vacuums</h3>
        <p>Heirs act as backup rulers if the King dies unexpectedly, reducing the risk of long-term <a href="succession.html">Interregnum</a>. Multiple heirs mean multiple safeguards against total succession collapse.</p>

        <h3>5. Political Signaling</h3>
        <p>Appointing heirs sends a message to the realm about who the King favors, creating alliances and deterring rivals. The <strong>order of precedence</strong> signals the King's priorities and strategic alignments.</p>

        <h3>6. Dynasty Insurance (Permadeath)</h3>
        <p>In a permadeath environment, no successor is guaranteed to survive. Multiple heirs are <strong>survival insurance</strong> — if one dies, another carries the dynasty forward. This is not paranoia, it's pragmatism.</p>

        <h2>❓ Can Heirs Be Revoked or Reordered?</h2>
        <p><strong>Yes.</strong> While the King lives, they have absolute control over heir appointments:</p>
        
        <h3>What the King Can Do:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Revoke any Heir status</strong> — remove Primary, Secondary, or Tertiary at will</li>
            <li><strong>Reorder heir precedence</strong> — promote Secondary to Primary, demote Primary to Tertiary, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Replace heirs entirely</strong> — appoint new heirs based on shifting politics or loyalty</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce the number of heirs</strong> — go from three heirs to one, or eliminate all heirs entirely</li>
            <li><strong>Punish disloyalty</strong> — remove Heir designation as political punishment</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="key-point">
            <strong>Strategic Heir Management:</strong> A King may deliberately reorder heirs as a <strong>political signal</strong> — promoting loyal heirs, demoting suspected traitors, or balancing competing factions by shifting precedence.
        </div>

        <h3>After the King Dies:</h3>
        <p>Once the King dies, <strong>all heir designations are locked in</strong>. The precedence at the moment of death determines claim strength during succession. No one can revoke or reorder heirs after the King is dead — only coronation resolves who becomes the next King.</p>

            <strong>Summary:</strong> The Heir Presumptive holds the <em>strongest claim</em> to the throne, but <strong>zero King powers</strong>. They must navigate Regents, Claimants, and political chaos to reach coronation and become the true King or Queen. Legitimacy alone is not enough — they must secure the Crown.
