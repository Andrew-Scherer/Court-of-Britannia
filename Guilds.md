# 🏛️ Guilds

**Organizations, Religions, Political Bodies, and Collective Power**

---


## What Are Guilds?

A guild can also be considered an **Organization**, **Group**, **Religion**, **Political Body**, or any other group of members that rallies under the same cause and banner.

Guilds allow players to not only turn themselves into a formidable group, but it also allows them to control a single guild house in a more permanent way.


> *A guild is where your legacy lives beyond your character.*


## Guilds Give


- **Shared property** — Hall, estate, buildings
- **Shared storage** — Chests, containers
- **Banners/colors** — Visual identity
- **Legal recognition** — Can petition court as a unit
- **Membership and group action** — Ability to act collectively


> Guilds answer: "Who do you stand with?"


## Examples of Player Created Guilds


## Why Guilds Matter on a Permadeath Shard

In a world where characters can die permanently, guilds provide:


- **A central gathering point** — Guilds can't "mechanically" begin unless they control a property to place their guildstone within
- **Continuity** — The organization survives individual deaths
- **Legacy** — Your accomplishments outlive your character
- **Collective power** — Groups can accomplish what individuals cannot
- **Memory** — Stories and rivalries persist across generations of characters


> When your character dies, your guild remembers. Your enemies remember. Your stories persist.


## Creating Player Guilds

Players can create their own guilds through a two-stage process:


## What Established Guilds Get


| Reward | Description |
|---|---|
| Guild Identity | Guild name tag / guild title line |
| Legal Standing | Can petition court as a guild (together people are stronger), demand trials/duels under guild banner |
| Assets That Persist | Guild Hall ownership survives member permadeath, leadership changes don't delete assets. Asset ownership flows down the leadership chain of command. |
| Recruitment | Can "recruit" new members however they wish |


## Can Guild Leaders Hold Court Positions?


> **Note**
> **⚔️ Yes: Role-Stacking is Allowed**
>
> **Guild leadership does NOT conflict with holding official court positions.**
> This means:
> - A **King can also be the Guildmaster** of a powerful merchant guild
> - A **Marshal can also lead** a military order or mercenary guild
> - A **Magistrate can also be** the head of a religious guild
> - A **Claimant can hold court office** while leading a guild power base
> **The only restriction:** You cannot hold multiple *major court offices* simultaneously (e.g., King + Marshal). But Guild leadership is NOT a court office — it's a separate organizational power structure.


### Why This Matters

Throughout history, political power and organizational leadership were often fused in the same person:


- **Merchant-Princes** — Rulers of Italian city-states who were also heads of banking guilds (e.g., the Medici)
- **Prince-Bishops** — Religious leaders who also ruled territories as secular lords
- **Grand Masters** — Leaders of military orders who commanded both religious brotherhoods and territorial armies

Separating "guild leader" from "political ruler" would be historically inaccurate. Power structures overlapped because the same people controlled multiple institutions.


> In Britannia:Your guild is your power base. Your court position is your legitimacy. Holding both makes you extraordinarily difficult to remove from power — exactly as it should be.

## Guilds May Form Factions

When multiple guilds choose to unite for political, military, or economic reasons, they may form a **faction**.


> **Note**
> **⚔️ What Are Factions?**
>
> **Factions are NOT a separate organization type.**
> Factions are **emergent alliances of guilds**—social, fragile, and kept brutally lightweight by design.
> **What factions provide:**
> - Shared banner/emblem (visual identity)
> - Shared faction name (cosmetic tag)
> **What factions do NOT have:**
> - No faction treasury
> - No faction upkeep
> - No faction leadership structure
> - No faction courts or treaties
> **If a faction collapses, nothing breaks mechanically.** Individual guilds continue to exist.

**→ See Emergent Factions for full details on how faction alliances form and why they're designed to be fragile**


## One Organization Type


> **Note**
> **🏛️ Critical Design Principle**
>
> **Guilds are the ONLY sovereign organization type in Britannia.**
> All guilds—whether formed by players or claiming pre-placed locations—share the same mechanics:
> - **Property ownership and upkeep** → [[Guild Upkeep|Guild-Upkeep]]
> - **Banking system (Treasury + Upkeep Ledger)** → [[Guild Banking|Guild-Banking]]
> - **Vendor mechanics** → [[Player Controlled Vendors|Player-Controlled-Vendors]]
> - **Recognition from the Crown** → [[Crown Recognition|Crown-Recognition]]
> - **Legal accountability** → Individual guild leaders are responsible for their guild's actions
> **Factions are not a separate organization type.** They are voluntary alignment layers that guilds choose to join—cosmetic identity markers with no separate mechanics, no separate leadership, no separate upkeep, and no separate assets. When guilds join a faction, they remain guilds. The faction is simply a shared banner and name that multiple guilds display together.
> *Guilds are the institutions. Factions are the coalitions guilds form.*


## Summary


> *You don't need noble blood to change the realm.You need a cause, allies, and a place to gather.*

Guilds transform individual players into enduring institutions. They provide the organizational structure that allows collective action, political influence, and lasting legacy in a world where any character can die at any moment.

Whether you're founding a merchant empire, a religious order, a criminal syndicate, or a political movement, guilds are how you inscribe your mark on Britannia's history — not through the lifespan of a single character, but through the collective memory and continued action of the organization you build.


> The guild hall stands. The charter endures. The banner flies. Your character may die, but your guild remembers.
