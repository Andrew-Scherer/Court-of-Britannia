            Britannia is old. Long before players arrived, certain places already mattered—orc forts carved into hillsides, pirate coves hidden along the coast, forgotten keeps, ruined monasteries, bandit camps, ancient halls, and strongholds no Crown ever fully tamed.
        </div>
        
        <p>These locations are not set dressing.<br>
        They are <strong>historic sites of power</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>This system exists to answer one simple question:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Who gets to claim them—and why?</strong></p>
        
        <p>The answer is not lore.<br>
        The answer is not admin assignment.<br>
        The answer is <strong>commitment</strong>.</p>
        
        <h2>What Are Historic Properties?</h2>
        
        <p>Historic properties are <strong>permanent world fixtures</strong>—iconic locations that already exist on the map at server start.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Examples include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Orc Forts</li>
            <li>Pirate Coves and Smuggler Havens</li>
            <li>Undead Keeps and Ruined Strongholds</li>
            <li>Remote Monasteries or Cult Sites</li>
            <li>Bandit Camps and Rebel Outposts</li>
            <li>Prestigious or Unique Buildings with historical weight</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Critical Distinction</h3>
            <p><strong>The property is permanent.</strong><br>
            <strong>Occupation is temporary.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Historic sites outlive all guilds.<br>
            Guilds are temporary occupants.<br>
            The world does not forget.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Britannia Is Not Empty Land</h2>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Custom house placement is disabled.</strong>
            <p>There are no housing deeds.</p>
            <p>There is no free-placement construction.</p>
            <p>Players do not create new structures.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>This is intentional.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Britannia is not empty land waiting to be filled.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Players move into history. They do not redraw it.</p>
        
        <p>Every place worth holding already exists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Existing buildings on the world map</li>
            <li>Historic properties (forts, keeps, coves, monasteries, ruins)</li>
            <li>Camps, tents, or temporary structures embedded in the world</li>
            <li>Fixed, world-embedded locations</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="quote-simple">
            Power comes from occupying meaningful locations.<br>
            Not from creating new ones.
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Geography is finite and contested.</strong></p>
        
        <p>There is:</p>
        <ul class="x-list">
            <li>No free-placement housing</li>
            <li>No custom plot claiming</li>
            <li>No deed-based house construction</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>All residency is <strong>location-based</strong>, not blueprint-based.</p>
        
        <p>Properties are acquired through <strong>public auction</strong> when they become vacant.</p>
        
        <p>This gives every guild a chance to pool funds and compete for a location.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Guilds can occupy only a single location at once.</strong></p>
        
        <p>You do not build a fort.<br>
        <strong>You win one at auction.</strong></p>
        
        <p>You do not construct a keep.<br>
        <strong>You bid for one.</strong></p>
        
        <p>You do not place a house.<br>
        <strong>You acquire one.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>How Ownership Works</h2>
        
        <p>Historic properties are sold through <strong>open public auction</strong>.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Anyone may bid</li>
            <li>All bids are visible</li>
            <li>The highest bidder wins control of the property</li>
            <li>The winner must establish guild presence by <strong>placing a guildstone</strong> within the purchased territory</li>
            <li>Upkeep begins immediately</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>You do NOT buy a guildstone.</strong>
            <p>You buy control of an existing property.</p>
            <p>You bring your own guildstone and place it within the territory you now control.</p>
            <p>The guildstone marks your occupation—it does not create the property.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Guildstones mark occupation:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Player-created</li>
            <li>Player-placed</li>
            <li>Guild-owned</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Once occupation is established, players may furnish, decorate, and operate the property as traditional home ownership allows—placing vendors, furniture, and other objects within the space they control.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Historic sites themselves are:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Permanent world fixtures</li>
            <li>Independent of any guild's existence</li>
            <li>Continuously contestable</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The guildstone is a marker of occupation, not construction.</p>
        
        <h2>Claiming Is a Process, Not a Moment</h2>
        
        <p>Winning an auction does not instantly secure a historic property. It grants the right to claim it.</p>
        
        <p>After an auction concludes, the winning bidder has a limited window to establish occupation by placing a guildstone within the territory. During this time, the location remains dangerous and contested — but the claim itself cannot be invalidated by a single death or ambush.</p>
        
        <p>If the claim is not completed within the window, the property returns to public auction.</p>
        
        <p><strong>This ensures that historic sites are taken by organization and persistence, not by timing or grief.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>What Happens When a Guild Collapses?</h2>
        
        <p>If the owning guild disbands, collapses, or fails to pay upkeep:</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>The Property Persists</h3>
            <p>The historic site <strong>does NOT disappear</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>Instead:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The guildstone is removed</li>
                <li>Control reverts to the world</li>
                <li>The site is automatically returned to <strong>public auction</strong></li>
                <li>The starting bid is <strong>1 gold</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>History persists even when banners fall.</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The buildings remain.<br>
        The walls endure.<br>
        The geography does not change.</p>
        
        <p>This ensures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No admin cleanup required</li>
            <li>No historical erasure</li>
            <li>Continuous contestation</li>
            <li>The world remembers what guilds forget</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="quote-simple">
            Guilds are temporary.<br>
            Places are permanent.<br>
            Power is inherited through occupation, not construction.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Identity Emerges From Commitment</h2>
        
        <p>There are <strong>no theme restrictions</strong>, no racial locks, no roleplay enforcement.</p>
        
        <div class="quote-simple">
            If you want it, you pay for it.<br>
            If you can't afford to keep it, you lose it.
        </div>
        
        <p>An Orc Fort is not "for orcs" because the system says so.<br>
        It becomes an Orc Fort because:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Orc-aligned players value it more</li>
            <li>They are willing to pool gold</li>
            <li>They accept the upkeep burden</li>
            <li>They are ready to defend it socially and militarily</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The system doesn't force orcs into the fort.<br>
        It simply lets the people who care most win.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Ownership is determined by:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Willingness to pay</li>
            <li>Willingness to organize</li>
            <li>Willingness to endure upkeep and pressure</li>
            <li>Willingness to defend what you occupy</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What If the "Wrong" Group Occupies It?</h2>
        
        <p>That's not a problem.<br>
        <strong>That's content.</strong></p>
        
        <p>If a human merchant guild occupies an Orc Fort:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Orc players now have a clear enemy</li>
            <li>The guild must justify its presence</li>
            <li>Recognition may be denied</li>
            <li>Trade may become dangerous</li>
            <li>Upkeep pressure increases under hostility</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Either the guild:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Holds it by force and narrative ("We conquered this place")</li>
            <li>Or loses it economically or violently</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Both outcomes are valid.<br>
        Both create stories.</strong></p>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>The system does not protect identity claims.</strong>
            <p>Players do.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Upkeep Is the Real Gatekeeper</h2>
        
        <p>Historic sites are not cheap trophies.</p>
        
        <p>They:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have higher assessed value</li>
            <li>Carry higher daily upkeep</li>
            <li>Attract attention, rivals, and scrutiny</li>
            <li>Paint a target on their owners</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This ensures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inactive ownership collapses naturally</li>
            <li>Theme squatters fail quickly</li>
            <li>Only organized, invested groups survive long-term</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="quote-simple">
            If you cannot sustain the cost, the land returns to the world.<br><br>
            No admin cleanup.<br>
            No zombie guilds.<br>
            No stagnation.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Scale Matters</h2>
        
        <p>Not all historic properties are equal. Some locations are small, quiet, and easily held. Others are famous, valuable, and watched.</p>
        
        <p>The larger and more significant a site is, the more pressure it attracts — economically, politically, and militarily. Holding such places requires coordination, presence, and endurance over time.</p>
        
        <p>Britannia does not forbid solitary claimants. It simply tests whether they can survive what they have taken.</p>
        
        <h2>City Property vs Historic Property</h2>
        
        <p>Property within Britain's city limits exists under law. Guards respond, violence has consequences, and stability is the norm. These locations are suited for individuals and small groups who wish to live, trade, and operate within protection.</p>
        
        <p>Historic properties exist beyond that protection. They are visible, valuable, and contested. Holding them requires organization, defense, and endurance over time. Recognition is not assumed, and power is never secure.</p>
        
        <p>Britannia does not rank these spaces. It distinguishes them. One offers safety through law. The other offers influence through risk.</p>
        
        <h2>Crown Recognition: Political, Not Mechanical</h2>
        
        <p>Owning a historic site does not grant legitimacy by default.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>The Crown Does Not Decide Ownership</h3>
            <p><strong>The Crown decides legitimacy.</strong></p>
            
            <p>That distinction is everything.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>The Crown may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recognize the occupying guild as lawful authority</li>
            <li>Tolerate them without endorsement</li>
            <li>Outlaw them as rebels, criminals, or pretenders</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Recognition is <strong>political, not mechanical</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Recognition affects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trade access</li>
            <li>Legal standing</li>
            <li>Liens and seizure risk</li>
            <li>Narrative framing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>But recognition does not determine who controls land.<br>
        <strong>Gold and survival do.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>Why This System Works</h2>
        
        <p>This design solves several problems at once:</p>
        
        <ul class="x-list">
            <li>No admin lore policing</li>
            <li>No forced roleplay</li>
            <li>No permanent land squatting</li>
            <li>No historical erasure when guilds fail</li>
            <li>No zombie properties</li>
            <li>No sprawling custom housing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>And it creates:</p>
        
        <ul class="check-list">
            <li>Market-driven identity</li>
            <li>Earned legitimacy</li>
            <li>Automatic conflict generation</li>
            <li>Clean failure states</li>
            <li>Player-authored history</li>
            <li>World memory that persists beyond individual guilds</li>
            <li>Finite, contested geography</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="quote-simple">
            Power flows from:<br>
            Gold → Occupation → Defense → Recognition<br><br>
            Not from construction or customization.
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Core Philosophy</h2>
        
        <p>Historic places do not belong to races, factions, or themes.</p>
        
        <p>They belong to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Those willing to pay</li>
            <li>Those willing to organize</li>
            <li>Those willing to endure pressure</li>
            <li>Those willing to defend occupation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="quote-simple">
            If you want to be orcs—occupy the fort.<br>
            If you want to be pirates—hold the cove.<br>
            If you want to be rebels—survive without recognition.
        </div>
        
        <p>Britannia does not ask who you are.<br>
        <strong>It watches what you can hold.</strong></p>
        
        <p><strong>Every place worth holding already exists.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>The World Does Not Forget</h2>
        
        <p>Every historic property has outlived countless guilds.</p>
        
        <p>When your guild falls:</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        
        <p>Historic properties are permanent world fixtures that guilds temporarily occupy. They are sold via public auction, and winning bidders establish control by placing a guildstone within the purchased territory.</p>
        
        <p>Custom house placement is disabled. Players cannot create new structures. All residency is location-based—players occupy existing buildings, not construct new ones.</p>
        
        <p>When guilds collapse or fail upkeep, the guildstone is removed and the property returns to auction at 1 gold starting bid. The site persists. History persists. The world does not forget.</p>
        
        <p>Ownership is determined by commitment—willingness to pay, organize, defend, and endure—not by theme, race, or lore. The Crown recognizes legitimacy, not ownership. Recognition is political.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Places are permanent. Guilds are temporary. Power is inherited through occupation, not construction.</strong></p>
