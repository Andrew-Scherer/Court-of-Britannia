# 🏴‍☠️ Sacking Britain

## Purpose

Sacking Britain represents a **rare civic catastrophe**—the consequence of a total failure to secure legitimacy during succession.

Britain cannot collapse mechanically.
But it **can be violated politically**.

A sack is not a reward for strength.
It is the price of indecision, violence, and institutional failure.

---

## Core Principle

> **Britain is the sole civic authority.
> If Britain cannot crown a King, even its gold is unsafe.**

Sacking exists to ensure that succession crises are dangerous, visible, and consequential.

---

## When Britain Can Be Sacked

Britain becomes **eligible to be sacked** only when **all** of the following conditions are met:

### 1. The Crown Is Vacant

* No active King exists.

---

### 2. A Coronation Cycle Has Elapsed

* A Coronation Cycle begins when the **first coronation attempt** is initiated.
* The cycle lasts **15 minutes**.
* During this cycle:

  * Any number of coronation attempts may occur.
  * A successful coronation immediately ends the cycle.

---

### 3. At Least One Coronation Attempt Has Failed

* A failed attempt is one that is **interrupted by damage, death, or forced movement**.
* Simply starting and canceling an attempt does **not** count.
* This ensures sacking cannot be triggered by a single bad-faith interruption.

---

### 4. No Legitimate Successor Authority Is Present

Britain **cannot** be sacked if **any** of the following are alive and present in Britain:

* The Regent
* Any Named Heir (Primary, Secondary, or Tertiary)

Britain becomes sackable only if **all** of the following are true:

* The Regent is dead, exiled, imprisoned, or absent
* All Named Heirs are dead, exiled, imprisoned, or absent

Claimants do **not** block sacking.

This preserves the succession triangle:

* Regent = power without claim
* Heir = claim without power
* Claimant = contested ambition

Sacking occurs only when **all stabilizing centers fail**.

---

## The Sack Window

When all conditions are met, a **Sack Window** opens.

* The Sack Window opens immediately.
* It lasts **10 minutes**, unless ended early (see below).
* During this window, the Royal Treasury becomes vulnerable.

The city does not "become lawless."
The **state becomes exposed**.

---

## How Sacking Works

Sacking is a **distributed action**, not a single withdrawal.

### The Treasury Vault

* A single world object representing the Royal Treasury.
* During the Sack Window, it may be interacted with by any player.

---

### Sack Action

* Any player may attempt to sack Britain by interacting with the Treasury Vault.
* Each attempt requires:

  * **Uninterrupted channeling** for a fixed duration
* On success:

  * **2% of the current treasury** is withdrawn
  * The gold is paid directly to the looter
  * A permanent public record is created

Multiple players may sack independently and simultaneously.

This models historical sacking:

* chaotic
* individual
* dangerous
* contested

---

## Sack Limits (Hard Guardrails)

Sacking cannot destroy Britain.

### Maximum Treasury Loss

* A Sack Window may remove **up to 50%** of the treasury.
* Once this cap is reached:

  * the Treasury Vault locks
  * further sack attempts fail
  * the Sack Window may continue, but the gold is gone

### No Reset Farming

* The cap applies **per Sack Window**
* Additional failed coronation cycles are required to reopen sacking

---

## Public Records

Every successful sack is recorded permanently.

Each record includes:

* Name of the looter
* Amount taken
* Time and date
* The failed Coronation Cycle that enabled it

Records appear in:

* Royal Treasury Ledger
* Public Chronicle
* Succession Records (where applicable)

Britain enforces nothing.
It remembers everything.

---

## Ending a Sack Window

A Sack Window ends immediately if:

* A coronation succeeds
  **or**
* The 10-minute window expires

Once ended:

* the Treasury Vault locks
* sacking is impossible until another eligible crisis occurs

Legitimacy restores closure—even mid-chaos.

---

## What Sacking Does *Not* Do

Sacking Britain does **not**:

* grant political authority
* create a King
* end the interregnum
* disable guards or NPC systems
* protect looters from retaliation
* hide responsibility

It creates evidence, not immunity.

---

## Design Intent

This system ensures that:

* succession crises carry real economic risk
* heirs matter even without power
* regents matter even without legitimacy
* killing a single role is insufficient
* bad-faith exploits are blocked
* failure is public and memorable

Sacking is not content.
It is consequence.

---

## Summary

> **Britain can only be sacked when the court proves it cannot crown a King.**

When that happens:

* gold is lost
* legitimacy shatters
* history is written
* retaliation follows

Britain does not fall.

It is **shamed**.
