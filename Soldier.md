**The Force That Holds or Breaks**

---


## What a Soldier Is


> *Soldiers are Britain's capacity to project lethal force where law does not function and restraint means death.*

Where City Guards arrest and subdue, Soldiers destroy resistance. Where Diplomats negotiate and witness, Soldiers make Britain's threats real. They are not peacekeepers. They are not police. They are force applied until the problem ends.

Soldiers exist to:


- Fight in environments where arrest is meaningless
- Hold territory through presence and violence
- Deter threats before they reach Britain
- Follow orders without civilian oversight
- Accept casualties as the cost of victory

A soldier's loyalty is to their commander first, Britain second, and ideals last.


## Authority and Position

Soldiers hold the lowest rank in Britain's military hierarchy but represent the most direct expression of military power:


- Appointed by officers under Captain of the Crown authority
- Answer to Captain of the Crowns and Lord of the Royal Army
- Do not answer to Guards, Magistrates, or civilian courts
- Operate under military discipline, not city law
- Can be unlimited in number based on recruitment capacity


> **Note**
> **Recruitment Model**
>
> **Unlimited Positions**
> Unlike Guards (who have caps on Captains and Marshal) or Captain of the Crowns (limited to 3), Soldiers can be recruited without numerical limit. This creates:
> - Mass mobilization potential during crises
> - Large veteran networks loyal to specific Captain of the Crowns
> - The possibility of military superiority over civilian forces


## Core Duties

Soldiers are responsible for:


- **Combat operations** — Engaging enemies with lethal force
- **Patrol and reconnaissance** — Monitoring borders and hostile territories
- **Garrison duty** — Holding forts, camps, and protectorates
- **Escort missions** — Protecting convoys, nobles, and diplomats in dangerous regions
- **Siege operations** — Attacking or defending fortified positions
- **Occupation enforcement** — Maintaining Britain's control over subjugated factions
- **Following orders** — Executing commands from Captain of the Crowns without question

Soldiers do not negotiate. They do not arrest. They do not preserve enemies for trial. They fight until resistance ends.


## Soldier vs City Guard: Critical Distinction


| Aspect | City Guard | Soldier |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Internal law enforcement | External force projection |
| Jurisdiction | Within Britain's walls | Beyond Britain's walls |
| Default Force | Non-lethal subdual and arrest | Lethal combat |
| Accountability | Subject to Magistrate review | Answers to military chain only |
| Goal | Preserve for trial | Destroy resistance |
| Culture | Restraint and legality | Survival and victory |


> **❗ Note**
> Yes — but not simultaneously. A player may serve as a Guard within Britain, then be reassigned to Military service externally. This transition is visible and political:
> - "The Guard has been militarized"
> - "Britain is escalating"
> - "This isn't policing anymore"
> That visibility creates tension, which is good design.


## Use of Force

Soldiers default to lethal force. They:


- Kill enemies rather than arrest them
- Prioritize soldier survival over enemy preservation
- Use overwhelming violence to minimize their own casualties
- Do not hesitate due to legal review
- Treat mercy as strategic choice, not moral obligation


### When Soldiers Show Restraint

Soldiers exercise restraint only when:


- Explicitly ordered to capture rather than kill
- Demonstrating Britain's power to encourage surrender
- Preserving high-value targets for intelligence
- Civilian casualties would create political problems

This restraint is calculated, not compassionate.


## Training and Culture

Soldiers are not civilians. They are trained for:


- **Lethality** — Efficient killing in close and ranged combat
- **Discipline** — Following orders under stress without debate
- **Endurance** — Operating in hostile environments for extended periods
- **Unit cohesion** — Trusting fellow soldiers over outsiders
- **Brutality** — Accepting and inflicting violence without hesitation


### Military Culture vs Civilian Culture

Soldiers develop distinct values:


- Loyalty to unit over ideology
- Obedience to commanders over law
- Results over process
- Strength over mercy
- Veterans over civilians


> "You weren't there. You don't understand. We do what we must."

This culture creates solidarity among soldiers and alienation from civilians. Long-service soldiers often trust other soldiers more than Britain's civilian leadership.


## Relationship With Captain of the Crowns

Soldiers follow Captain of the Crowns because:


- Captain of the Crowns appoint them
- Captain of the Crowns lead them in combat
- Captain of the Crowns keep them alive
- Captain of the Crowns secure pay, supplies, and rest
- Captain of the Crowns share their dangers and victories

This creates **vertical loyalty**: soldiers obey Captain of the Crowns immediately and the Crown theoretically.


### When Orders Conflict

If the Crown orders one action and the Captain of the Crown orders another, soldiers face a choice:


- Obey distant authority they've never met
- Obey the commander who's kept them alive

History shows soldiers follow Captain of the Crowns.


> **❗ Note**
> A Captain of the Crown with 20 loyal soldiers controls:
> - A force capable of defeating most civilian resistance
> - Leverage in succession disputes
> - The ability to refuse orders with impunity
> - A path to seizing power if aligned with other commanders


## Pay, Supplies, and Loyalty

Soldiers serve for:


- **Payment** — Regular wages from the Crown or Captain of the Crown
- **Plunder** — Share of captured resources during campaigns
- **Land grants** — Rewards for long service or exceptional valor
- **Prestige** — Status as hardened veterans
- **Brotherhood** — Bonds formed through shared combat


### When Payment Stops

Unpaid soldiers become:


- Unreliable in combat
- Vulnerable to rival offers
- Willing to plunder civilians
- Loyal to whoever pays them next

A regime that cannot pay its soldiers loses them—or becomes their victim.


> "The soldiers are three months behind on wages. The Captain of the Crown says the Crown has abandoned them."


## Veterans and the Problem of Peace

Soldiers trained for war do not transition easily to peace:


- They are accustomed to solving problems through violence
- They distrust civilian authority that never faced combat
- They form tight networks that exclude non-veterans
- They expect continued employment or land


### Veteran Integration (Or Lack Thereof)

When campaigns end, Britain faces a choice:


- **Reward veterans** — Land grants, pensions, positions of authority
- **Disband and dismiss** — Send them home without support
- **Keep them active** — Find new conflicts to justify continued military spending

Dismissed veterans without support become:


- Bandits and mercenaries
- Recruits for rival factions
- The core of rebellions
- A permanent underclass hostile to the regime


> **❗ Note**
> Roman General Gaius Marius recruited soldiers from the poor and promised them land after service. When the Senate refused to honor those promises, veterans followed Marius—not Rome.
> This pattern repeated until veteran loyalty to generals replaced loyalty to the state, and Rome's Republic collapsed into military dictatorship.


## Soldiers and Succession Crises

When the Crown is contested, soldiers become the deciding factor.


### How Soldiers Choose

Soldiers back claimants based on:


- **Captain of the Crown loyalty** — "Our commander backs this claimant, so we do too"
- **Payment promises** — "This claimant will pay us; the other won't"
- **Victory likelihood** — "We follow winners, not doomed causes"
- **Personal connections** — "This claimant fought beside us; the other never left the castle"


### Soldiers as Kingmakers

A claimant with military backing wins:


- They control the means of violence
- They can siege the capital or defend it
- They become *de facto* ruler even if not *de jure*


> The King sits on the throne.But the soldiers decide who sits there.


## Internal Deployment: When Soldiers Enter Britain

Normally, soldiers operate externally while Guards handle internal enforcement. But during crises:


- Guards request military backup during riots or invasions
- The Crown declares martial law and deploys soldiers inside Britain
- Military commanders claim civilian authority has collapsed


### Consequences of Internal Deployment

When soldiers patrol Britain's streets:


- Lethal force becomes standard response
- Legal protections weaken or disappear
- Public perceives regime as militarized
- Soldiers become familiar with the capital's layout and vulnerabilities
- Coup risk increases dramatically


> **❗ Note**
> "Soldiers inside the city walls" is a historical indicator of regime collapse. Either:
> - The regime is so weak it cannot maintain order with Guards alone, or
> - The regime is preparing to suppress internal opposition with overwhelming force
> Both signal instability.


## Why Play This?

If Guards are about:


- Law and restraint
- Arrest and custody
- Visible authority

And Captain of the Crowns are about:


- Regional power
- Political ambition
- Command authority

Soldiers are about:


- Direct combat
- Unit brotherhood
- Following orders
- Survival through violence

Soldier players get:


- Combat-focused gameplay without legal constraints
- External campaign participation
- Military unit membership and camaraderie
- Opportunities for promotion to officer or Captain of the Crown
- Political leverage during succession crises
- And the long-term choice of whom to obey when orders conflict

**This is the role for players who want to fight, follow capable leaders, and decide Britain's fate when authority fractures.**
