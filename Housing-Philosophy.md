# 🏠 How Housing Works

**Where You Stand in the World, Not What You Hide Behind Walls**

---


> *Housing is about where you stand in the world, not what you hide behind walls.*


## The Core Philosophy

Housing on this shard works **fundamentally differently** from traditional Ultima Online.

This is not "standard UO with tweaks."

This is a **new mental model**.


> **Note**
> **What Housing Is**
>
> - A **social hub**
> - A **political statement**
> - A **place in the world**
> - A means of **expression and identity**


> **Note**
> **What Housing Is NOT**
>
> - A vault for hoarding items
> - A permanent storage solution
> - A mechanism for insulating progress
> - A way to safely accumulate power


## The Mental Model Shift Is Intentional

Players will be upset — then adapt — then prefer this.


> Initial reaction:"Where do I store my stuff?""What's the point of housing?"


> Later realization:Less anxietyMore cooperationCleaner lossesStronger politics

This shard is not old Ultima with tweaks.  

**It is a new Ultima mental model.**


## Core Concepts


## The One Sentence


> *Housing is about where you stand in the world, not what you hide behind walls.*

Everything else flows from that.


## Why This Works

Traditional housing systems create:


- Hoarding anxiety
- Shell guild fragmentation
- Storage micromanagement
- Quit-inducing losses
- Housing-as-entrenchment gameplay

This system creates:


- Social cohesion
- Political stakes
- Meaningful choice
- Fair losses
- Housing-as-expression gameplay


> You've made a rare thing here:A housing system that actually supports politics instead of undermining it.
