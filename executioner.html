            The Executioner does not decide justice.<br>
            The Executioner embodies consequence.
        </div>

        <h2>What the Executioner Is</h2>
        
        <p>The Executioner is an officer of the Crown who performs lawful executions. They are the public agent through whom irreversible punishment becomes visible and real. The role exists to give consequence a face and finality a human presence.</p>
        
        <p>The Executioner does not choose who dies. They do not investigate crimes, judge guilt, or determine sentences. They act only on lawful authority granted by the Magistrate and serve at the pleasure of the Crown.</p>
        
        <p>They are not a judge. They are not a guard. They are the embodiment of the Crown's final answer to defiance.</p>
        
        <h3>The Role's Defining Characteristics</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>They legitimize punishment through action.</strong> A sentence becomes real when the Executioner carries it out. Without this act, punishment remains abstract decree.</li>
            <li><strong>They absorb political consequence.</strong> Every execution creates enemies. Those enemies focus their anger on the Executioner, not solely the Crown or Magistrate.</li>
            <li><strong>They are public, named, and remembered.</strong> Executions are recorded with the Executioner's identity. They cannot hide behind anonymity or bureaucracy.</li>
            <li><strong>They serve as the final human presence.</strong> When a character dies, the Executioner is the last agent of authority they encounter. This creates weight, not routine.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Executioner is not a mechanical function. They are a political burden carried by a specific individual who will be blamed, feared, and remembered.</p>

        <h2>Authority & Appointment</h2>
        
        <p>The Executioner holds authority derived entirely from the Crown. They do not operate independently, nor do they answer to the Magistrate in matters of appointment or removal.</p>
        
        <h3>Appointment Process</h3>
        
        <p>The Executioner is appointed by the King. No other authority may confer this office. The appointment is public and recorded in the official ledger of Crown appointments.</p>
        
        <p>The King may appoint an Executioner at any time and for any reason. There are no formal qualifications, trials, or selection processes required. The King's choice is final.</p>
        
        <h3>Removal and Dismissal</h3>
        
        <p>The Executioner serves at the pleasure of the Crown and may be removed by the King without cause or notice. Removal is immediate and absolute.</p>
        
        <p>Removal does not erase the political consequences of past executions. Former Executioners remain socially marked by their service and may continue to face reprisal from enemies of those they executed.</p>
        
        <h3>Acting in the Crown's Name</h3>
        
        <p>When the Executioner performs an execution, they act explicitly in the Crown's name. The authority for the act flows from the King, not from the Executioner personally.</p>
        
        <p>This structure has critical implications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Executions legitimize the Crown's power to enact finality</li>
            <li>The Crown owns the political outcome, not merely the Executioner</li>
            <li>Regimes are defined in part by who they execute and who carries out those sentences</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="state-box">
            <h4>Authority vs. Legitimacy</h4>
            <p>The <strong>Magistrate</strong> provides legal authority by issuing a lawful death sentence.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Executioner</strong> provides legitimacy by performing the sentence in the Crown's name.</p>
            <p>Both are required. Authority without action is impotent. Action without authority is murder.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Scarcity and Visibility</h2>
        
        <p>The Executioner role is intentionally scarce. This scarcity creates weight, consequence, and political significance. Execution must never feel routine, mechanical, or impersonal.</p>
        
        <h3>Recommended Limits</h3>
        
        <p><strong>One primary Executioner.</strong> A single individual serves as the official Executioner at any given time. They are publicly known, named on all execution records, and socially identified with the role.</p>
        
        <p><strong>One backup at most.</strong> In exceptional circumstances, the King may appoint a secondary Executioner to ensure continuity if the primary is absent or incapacitated. This is rare and creates political tension between the two holders.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Scarcity Matters</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Execution is irreversible.</strong> Permadeath cannot be undone. The role that enacts it must carry proportional weight. If executions become routine, they lose political and emotional significance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Execution concentrates blame.</strong> A small number of Executioners ensures that responsibility remains personal and identifiable. Enemies of the executed know exactly who to target for vengeance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Execution must remain exceptional.</strong> When multiple people can execute freely, the act loses its gravity. Scarcity preserves execution as the Crown's final response, not a default enforcement tool.</p>
        
        <h3>Visibility Requirements</h3>
        
        <p>The Executioner is <strong>publicly known</strong>. Their identity is not secret. Citizens know who holds the office. This visibility creates political accountability and social consequence.</p>
        
        <p>The Executioner is <strong>named on execution records</strong>. Every execution is logged with the Executioner's identity, the condemned's name, the authorizing Magistrate, and the date. This creates a permanent historical record.</p>
        
        <p>The Executioner is <strong>socially isolated by function</strong>. The role carries stigma. They are feared, avoided, or blamed depending on public sentiment. Social isolation is not a mechanical penalty—it is the natural consequence of enacting finality.</p>

        <h2>What the Executioner Does</h2>
        
        <p>The Executioner's responsibilities are narrow, specific, and irreversible. They do not enforce broadly—they finalize specifically.</p>
        
        <h3>Core Responsibilities</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Carry out lawful executions.</strong> When a Magistrate issues a death sentence and the Crown has not intervened, the Executioner performs the execution at the scheduled time.</li>
            <li><strong>Act on sentences issued by the Magistrate.</strong> The Executioner does not execute on personal authority. They act only when legal authorization exists.</li>
            <li><strong>Perform executions publicly when possible.</strong> Public executions serve as political theater and warning. The Executioner conducts these ceremonies when attendance and timing allow.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve as the final human presence in punishment.</strong> The Executioner is the last agent of the Crown that the condemned encounters. This personal presence distinguishes lawful execution from mechanical deletion.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>What This Means in Practice</h3>
        
        <p>When a death sentence is issued, the Executioner is notified of the scheduled execution window (typically 2 hours). If the condemned appears during this window, the Executioner may perform the execution personally through a single-blow action that causes instant permadeath.</p>
        
        <p>The condemned is transported to the public execution site while subdued and cannot flee. The Executioner approaches and delivers the final blow in a visible, public act.</p>
        
        <p>The Executioner's presence enables ceremony, visibility, and public legitimation. Their absence does not prevent justice—it simply means another Crown agent performs the act or execution proceeds automatically if the condemned does not appear.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Absorbing Stigma and Consequence</h3>
            <p>The Executioner is remembered. They are named in records. They are blamed by allies of the condemned. They become associated with specific regimes and political eras.</p>
            <p>This is intentional. The role exists to prevent the Crown from hiding behind abstraction. Someone must be seen doing the irreversible act.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What the Executioner Does Not Do</h2>
        
        <p>The Executioner's authority is strictly limited to carrying out lawful sentences. They have no investigative, judicial, or enforcement powers beyond this specific function.</p>
        
        <h3>Explicit Exclusions</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Investigate crimes.</strong> The Executioner does not gather evidence, interview witnesses, or determine facts. Investigation is the responsibility of Guards and Crown agents.</li>
            <li><strong>Arrest suspects.</strong> The Executioner does not patrol, pursue, or detain. Arrest authority belongs to Guards and other law enforcement roles.</li>
            <li><strong>Interrogate prisoners.</strong> The Executioner does not question the condemned or extract confessions. Interrogation is conducted by Guards or judicial officers.</li>
            <li><strong>Sentence or commute punishment.</strong> The Executioner does not decide who deserves death or mercy. Sentencing is the Magistrate's authority. Commutation is the Crown's prerogative.</li>
            <li><strong>Grant mercy.</strong> The Executioner cannot pardon, delay, or reduce sentences. Only the King holds mercy authority.</li>
            <li><strong>Override the Crown.</strong> The Executioner serves the Crown. They cannot refuse a lawful execution on personal moral grounds without facing removal and political consequences.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These exclusions exist to ensure that the Executioner remains a specialized, burdened office rather than a general enforcement role. Their power is narrow and final—not broad and preventative.</p>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>The Executioner is not a super-guard.</strong> They do not enforce law broadly. They finalize specific sentences issued through proper judicial authority. Expanding their role beyond this creates dangerous consolidation of power.
        </div>

        <h2>Relationship to Other Offices</h2>
        
        <p>The Executioner operates within a framework of separated powers. They do not report to the Magistrate, nor do they control judicial outcomes. The relationship is one of interdependence, not hierarchy.</p>
        
        <h3>Magistrate and Executioner</h3>
        
        <p>The <strong>Magistrate sentences.</strong> They determine guilt, apply law, and issue formal death sentences. This is judicial authority.</p>
        
        <p>The <strong>Executioner performs.</strong> They carry out the sentence issued by the Magistrate. This is executive action.</p>
        
        <p>These roles are distinct and intentionally separated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Executioner does not "report" to the Magistrate on a day-to-day basis</li>
            <li>The Magistrate does not supervise executions personally</li>
            <li>The Executioner acts in the Crown's name, not as the Magistrate's subordinate</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>King and Executioner</h3>
        
        <p>The <strong>King owns the consequence.</strong> Every execution is performed in the Crown's name. The political outcome—legitimacy gained or eroded—belongs to the Crown, not solely the Executioner.</p>
        
        <p>The Executioner acts as the King's hand, not as an independent authority. The King may intervene, delay, or commute sentences at any point before execution resolves.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Separation Matters</h3>
        
        <p>Collapsing these roles creates dangerous power consolidation:</p>
        
        <p>If the <strong>Magistrate also executes</strong>, judicial authority becomes insulated from consequence. Judges can sentence freely without absorbing the political and social cost of enacting finality.</p>
        
        <p>If the <strong>Executioner also sentences</strong>, execution becomes arbitrary and personal. The role transforms from burdened agent into judge-executioner with unchecked power.</p>
        
        <p>Separation ensures that multiple authorities must cooperate for execution to occur, creating checks, accountability, and distributed consequence.</p>

        <h2>Political Risk and Burden</h2>
        
        <p>The Executioner is not protected from political fallout. They are a lightning rod for vengeance, blame, and regime change consequences. This risk is inherent and intentional.</p>
        
        <h3>Executions Create Enemies</h3>
        
        <p>Every execution generates lasting enmity. Allies of the condemned remember. Bloodlines inherit grudges. Political factions mark the Executioner as an enemy of their cause.</p>
        
        <p>These enemies do not disappear when the execution is complete. They persist, organize, and seek opportunities for reprisal. The Executioner becomes a permanent target.</p>
        
        <h3>Regime Ties and Regime Change</h3>
        
        <p>The Executioner is tied to the regime they serve. If the Crown changes hands—through abdication, usurpation, or succession crisis—the Executioner may be seen as a symbol of the previous regime's violence.</p>
        
        <p>New regimes may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the Executioner immediately to signal a break from the past</li>
            <li>Execute the Executioner as symbolic justice for prior regime abuses</li>
            <li>Retain the Executioner to maintain continuity and demonstrate authority</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Executioner has no inherent protection. Their survival depends on political fortune, not role immunity.</p>
        
        <h3>Social Isolation and Stigma</h3>
        
        <p>The role carries social weight that persists beyond the office. Even former Executioners remain marked by their service. They are remembered as the person who enacted finality in the Crown's name.</p>
        
        <p>This isolation is not a mechanical penalty—it is the natural consequence of performing irreversible acts. Players in this role should expect to be feared, avoided, or blamed depending on the political climate.</p>
        
        <div class="state-box">
            <h4>The Role Is a Gamble</h4>
            <p>Serving as Executioner grants proximity to Crown authority and visibility in political theater. It also creates permanent enemies and ties the holder's fate to regime stability.</p>
            <p>This is intentional. The role should feel consequential and dangerous, not safe or routine.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Refusal, Delay, and Absence</h2>
        
        <p>The Executioner may choose to refuse or delay executions. These choices carry social and political consequences but do not mechanically block execution systems.</p>
        
        <h3>Refusal to Execute</h3>
        
        <p>The Executioner may refuse to carry out a specific execution on moral, political, or personal grounds. This refusal is not mechanically prevented.</p>
        
        <p>Consequences of refusal:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Crown may remove the Executioner immediately for insubordination</li>
            <li>The execution proceeds through another Crown agent or automated resolution</li>
            <li>The Executioner's refusal becomes a public political statement</li>
            <li>Allies of the condemned may view the refusal as an act of conscience or weakness depending on context</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Delay and Scheduling Conflicts</h3>
        
        <p>If the Executioner is absent or unavailable during the execution window, the execution does not deadlock. Execution mechanics proceed independently to ensure justice is not blocked by player availability.</p>
        
        <p>If the condemned appears but the Executioner does not, another Crown agent may perform the execution. If neither appears, execution proceeds automatically when the window closes.</p>
        
        <p>Delay or absence creates political tension:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Crown appears unable to finalize punishment with dignity and ceremony</li>
            <li>Enemies of the condemned grow anxious or suspicious</li>
            <li>Allies of the condemned gain time within the window to petition for mercy</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Role Creates Pressure, Not Control</h3>
        
        <p>The Executioner's presence or absence creates <strong>political pressure</strong>, not mechanical control over whether execution occurs.</p>
        
        <p>Presence enables ceremony, public theater, and personal legitimation. Absence results in impersonal justice that proceeds without the Executioner's direct action.</p>
        
        <p>This design ensures that the role remains meaningful without becoming a single point of failure that can block the entire execution system.</p>

        <h2>Why the Role Exists</h2>
        
        <p>The Executioner exists to solve a fundamental problem of legitimate authority: systems without faces feel illegitimate.</p>
        
        <h3>Violence Without Ownership Corrodes Authority</h3>
        
        <p>If executions occur automatically without a named agent, the Crown can pretend that punishment is abstract, mechanical, or inevitable. This abstraction allows leaders to avoid accountability for finality.</p>
        
        <p>The Executioner prevents this evasion. Someone must be seen doing the irreversible act. That person absorbs consequence, blame, and political risk on behalf of the Crown.</p>
        
        <h3>Someone Must Be Named and Remembered</h3>
        
        <p>Execution is not merely a state change—it is a political event with lasting ripple effects. The Executioner's name appears on execution records. They are remembered by allies of the condemned. They become part of historical narrative.</p>
        
        <p>This permanence creates weight. Executions are not anonymous deletions. They are acts performed by specific individuals operating under specific authority at specific moments in political time.</p>
        
        <h3>The Role Humanizes Consequence</h3>
        
        <p>When a character dies by execution, the Executioner is the last agent of authority they encounter. This final human presence distinguishes lawful execution from mechanical death.</p>
        
        <p>The condemned see a person, not a system. Witnesses remember an individual, not an abstract process. This human element preserves the gravity of permadeath and prevents execution from feeling routine.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Design Principle</h3>
            <p>The Executioner exists so the Crown cannot pretend punishment was abstract. Authority requires ownership. Finality requires a face. The Executioner provides both.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="canon-box">
            <h3>Canon Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Executioner is an officer of the Crown who legitimizes punishment by performing irreversible acts in the Crown's name.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>They do not decide guilt. They do not grant mercy. They embody consequence.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Execution mechanics exist independently to ensure justice is not blocked by absence or scheduling.</strong></li>

        <h2>Role Summary</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authority source:</strong> Appointed and removed by the King. Acts in the Crown's name, not independently.</li>
            <li><strong>Core responsibility:</strong> Perform lawful executions issued by the Magistrate. Serve as the final human presence in irreversible punishment.</li>
            <li><strong>Scarcity matters:</strong> One primary Executioner ensures that execution remains exceptional, personal, and politically weighty rather than routine.</li>
            <li><strong>Political risk:</strong> Every execution creates permanent enemies. Regime changes put Executioners at risk. Social isolation and stigma persist beyond the office.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited authority:</strong> The Executioner does not investigate, arrest, interrogate, sentence, or grant mercy. Their power is narrow and final.</li>
            <li><strong>Separation from Magistrate:</strong> The Executioner acts in the Crown's name, not as the Magistrate's subordinate. Judicial authority and executive action remain distinct.</li>
            <li><strong>Refusal and absence:</strong> The Executioner may refuse or delay, creating political consequences. Absence does not block execution mechanics—it creates impersonal justice.</li>
            <li><strong>Named and remembered:</strong> The Executioner is publicly known and recorded on all execution documents. They cannot hide behind anonymity.</li>
            <li><strong>Why the role exists:</strong> To prevent the Crown from evading accountability for finality. Violence requires ownership. The Executioner provides a face for consequence.</li>
