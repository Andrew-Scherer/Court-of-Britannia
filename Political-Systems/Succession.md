# 👑 Succession & Crown Transfer

**What Happens When the King Dies**

---


> *The Crown transfers only at coronation.Until then, the realm is governed by a Regent, and the Heir holds only a claim.*


## Main Idea

Upon the King's death, the Crown is vacant. The Regent governs in trust. Named Heirs hold official claims in order of precedence. Claimants may assert contested claims through force or alliance. The Crown transfers only at coronation, where any eligible contender—Heir, Regent, or Claimant—may be crowned. Legitimacy is determined not by mechanics, but by who recognizes the outcome.


## Core Principle: Vacant Crown, Delegated Authority


> Crisis-first, story-forward model

**At the moment the King dies:**


> **Note**
> **The Succession Crisis Begins**
>
> - **The Crown is vacant** — No one is King
> - **The Heir holds a claim, not authority** — Symbol and blood right, but no powers
> - **The Regent holds King powers temporarily** — Full governance "in trust"
> - **Claimants may contest the succession** — Alternative claims through force or alliance
> - **Coronation = actual transfer of Crown authority** — The moment everything changes


## Authority Layer (Who holds power before coronation)


> **Note**
> **Power Structure During Vacancy**
>
> - **Regent holds all governing authority** — Full King powers, temporarily delegated
> - **Heirs hold symbolic legitimacy only** — Official claim, but no executive power
> - **Claimants hold nothing unless they seize it** — Contested legitimacy, no authority

This preserves the clean triangle:


> Heir= legitimacy without powerRegent= power without claimClaimant= claim without power

**That triangle is the engine of drama.**


## Eligibility Layer (Who is allowed to be crowned)

At the King's death, the following are eligible for coronation:


> **Note**
> **Eligibility for Coronation**
>
> - **Named Heirs (Primary / Secondary / Tertiary)**  

                → Official, ordered eligibility
> - **Claimants**  

                → Unofficial, contested eligibility
> - **The Regent**  

                → Procedural eligibility through custody of the state

**So the coronation is not about transfer — it is about selection.**


## The Key Distinction

**No one has King powers until coronation.**

The Regent holds sovereign authority, but not the Crown.

## Step-by-Step: What Happens When a King Dies

When a King dies and both an Heir and Regent exist:


## Succession is not a rule — it's a test.


> Heirs test legitimacyRegents test restraintClaimants test strength


## The Three-Way Dynamic: Heir vs Regent vs Claimant


### The Heir Presumptive


> **Note**
> **Legitimacy Without Power**
>
> **What they have:**
> - Official claim to the throne
> - Appointed by previous King OR bloodline succession
> - Public recognition
> - Legal standing
> **What they lack:**
> - King powers (cannot command guards, issue decrees)
> - Protection (vulnerable to assassination)
> - Certainty (coronation is not guaranteed)
> **Their goal:** Survive until coronation
> **→ Full details: Heir Presumptive**


### The Regent


> **Note**
> **Power Without Legitimacy**
>
> **What they have:**
> - All King powers (temporarily)
> - Command of guards
> - Ability to issue decrees
> - Control over the coronation process
> **What they lack:**
> - The Crown itself
> - Permanent legitimacy
> - Long-term stability
> **Their temptation:** Crown themselves instead of the Heir
> **→ Full details: The Regent**


### Claimants


> **Note**
> **Competing Claims**
>
> **What they have:**
> - Alternative claim to the throne (bloodline, conquest, right)
> - Potential supporters
> - Ability to contest the succession
> **What they lack:**
> - Official recognition (unlike the Heir)
> - Legal standing (their claim is disputed)
> - Power (unless they seize it)
> **Their goal:** Disrupt the coronation and press their own claim
> **→ Full details: Claimants**


## The Coronation Timer: Pressure Cooker

The moment the King dies and a Regent exists, a **coronation window** begins (typically 3-7 real days).


> **❗ Note**
> - There will be a coronation
> - Someone will be crowned
> - Or blood will be spilled


### What Can Happen During the Window


| Actor | Possible Actions |
|---|---|
| Heir | Secure protection, build alliances, survive assassination attempts |
| Regent | Govern, delay coronation (once), advance it (risky), or crown themselves |
| Claimants | Press claims, gather support, challenge legitimacy, plot coups |
| Marshal | Choose sides, protect Heir or back Regent, remain neutral |
| Nobles | Support various factions, negotiate deals, position for power |


## Why This Design Works


### It Preserves:


- **Succession tension** — Nothing is automatic
- **Regent temptation** — They hold all the cards
- **Heir vulnerability** — Claim without power is dangerous
- **Public legitimacy gameplay** — How people react matters


### It Creates Clean Drama:


- **Until coronation, everything is provisional** — No certainty
- **Every delay is suspicious** — What is the Regent waiting for?
- **Every protection detail matters** — The Heir can die
- **Every decree can be challenged later** — "REGENT AUTHORITY" is temporary


### It Avoids Edge-Case Confusion:


- **No "King but not really King"** — Clear states
- **No dual authority paradox** — One sovereign at a time
- **No diluted stakes** — Coronation is make-or-break


## Possible Outcomes


### Scenario 1: Peaceful Succession


1. King dies, Regent assumes power
2. Heir is protected during coronation window
3. Regent officiates coronation for Heir
4. Heir crowned, becomes King
5. Regent authority dissolves
6. **Stable transition**


### Scenario 2: Regent Usurpation


1. King dies, Regent assumes power
2. Regent delays coronation, builds support
3. Heir becomes vulnerable
4. Regent crowns themselves at coronation
5. Heir's claim invalidated (or Heir eliminated)
6. **Contested reign begins**


### Scenario 3: Claimant Uprising


1. King dies, Regent assumes power
2. Claimant gathers supporters
3. Challenges legitimacy of Heir
4. Forces way into coronation or disrupts it
5. Crowns themselves or backs different candidate
6. **Civil war potential**


### Scenario 4: Heir Assassination


1. King dies, Regent assumes power
2. Heir is assassinated during window
3. Succession crisis deepens
4. Regent must choose new heir or crown themselves
5. Claimants emerge
6. **Maximum chaos**


## Interregnum: No Regent Exists


> **❗ Note**
> The realm enters **Interregnum** — a true power vacuum.


### During Interregnum:


- No one has delegated King authority
- Marshal may declare emergency Regent through court process
- Coronation must happen immediately (no delay option)
- Maximum chaos and opportunity for coups
- Heir is most vulnerable

**This is why appointing a Regent is crucial for succession planning.**
