# 👑 The Coronation Ceremony

**The Sacred Rite That Creates Kings**

---


> *The Crown is not inherited — it is claimed through the sacred rite of coronation.Only those who sit upon the throne and complete the oath shall wear the Crown.*


## Core Principle


> **Note**
> **The Only Mechanical Gate**
>
> The coronation ceremony is the **single moment** where Crown authority transfers from vacancy to a living sovereign. There is no King until someone completes this ritual.
> This is not automatic. This is not guaranteed. This is **earned through presence, timing, and survival**.

The coronation is designed to be:


- **Ceremonial** — Feels ritualistic and meaningful
- **High-stakes** — Vulnerable, interruptible, and contested
- **Immersive** — Players witness the moment power changes hands
- **Political** — Forces alignment, protection, and betrayal into one moment


## The Cost of Spectacle


> **Note**
> **Coronations Drain the Treasury**
>
> Coronations are costly to the Crown and carry not just a political price, but a financial burden as well. The spectacle, ceremony, and public celebration required to legitimize a new sovereign depletes royal resources.
> **Mechanical Effect:** A coronation automatically reduces the Crown's coffers by **XX%** when it occurs.
> This cost represents:
> - Ceremonial arrangements and preparations
> - Public feasts and celebrations to maintain legitimacy
> - Gifts and favors to secure noble support
> - The inherent expense of transferring power
> This drain applies regardless of who is crowned—Heir, Regent, or Claimant. Power is expensive.
