# 🕯️ The Interregnum

**Five Phases of Blood, Allegiance, and Memory**

---

> *During the Interregnum, law is suspended, allegiance is fluid, and history is permanent.*

## Core Definition

The **Interregnum** is the ritualized chaos between a vacant throne and a crowned monarch. It is not a pause in the story — it is the story. The realm is fractured, loyalty is tested, and violence becomes a legal instrument of legitimacy.

Interregnum participation is **voluntary** and **high-stakes**. Those who enter are recorded forever.

---

## Global Rules (Apply Throughout Interregnum)

- **No crimes are recorded** against participants during Interregnum conflict windows.
- **Allegiance can change** without cooldown while a phase window is active.
- **Neutrality is protected**: Neutral players may not interfere (no attacking, healing, or obstruction).
- **Permadeath applies**: If you die during Interregnum, you can respawn, but your new character **cannot participate**.
- **Only living characters** from Phase 1 can affect the outcome.

## Conditions of Starting the Interregnum

1. There is no King or Queen. The spot is vacant either through the death of the King or Queen OR inactivity for 48 hours. If the King is inactive for 48 hours, the King spot is automatically vacated AND the Regent assumes control.

2. A Regent may or may not exist. Typically a Regent may trigger The Interregnum by:

- Declaring a beginning to The Interregnum through The Interregnum menu and setting a day which The Coronation begins.
-Regent Scheduling Authority - When the throne is vacant, the Regent may select the calendar day on which Phase 5 of The Coronation will occur. The selected day must be no sooner than 72 hours and no later than 5 days from the moment of scheduling. This window ensures adequate public notice while preventing indefinite delays or soft rule by postponement. 
- Fixed Coronation Time: Regardless of the chosen day, the Coronation always begins at 6:30 PM Pacific Time (PST). The Regent has no authority to alter the time of day. If the Regent fails to schedule a valid date within 24 hours, either through inactivity or apathy, the system will automatically assign the earliest valid Coronation day at 6:30 PM PST.
-Regent cannot cancel The Interregum process after selecting and scheduling the time.
-Once The Interregnum has started, it cannot be stopped.

3. If there is no Regent to declare a beginning to The Interregnum, the Interregnum will automatically select the soonest open day to begin the Interregnum.

## Phase 1: 72 Hours Before Interregnum

**Nomination Phase (24h)**

Eligible candidates must formally **nominate** themselves for the throne.

### Who May Nominate

- Guild Leaders
- High-Ranking Nobles
- The Regent
- Named Heirs
- Faction Leaders 

### Rules

- Nominations are **mechanically private** until Phase 2.
- Candidates may **withdraw at any time**, immediately.
- Nominations may be made in any city, not only Britain.

---

## Phase 2: 48 Hours Before Coronation

**Allegiance Declaration (24h)**

Individuals must declare allegiance to **one candidate** or remain neutral.

### Cascading Allegiance Logic

Allegiance cascades by hierarchy:

1. **Faction Leader** → sets faction-wide choice for all guilds in the faction.
2. **Guild Leader** → can accept the factions choice or choose to leave the faction and choose a different candidate.
3. **Individual** → can accept the guild choice or choose to leave the guild and choose a different candidate.

This leaves autonomy for individuals to choose their own allegiance, even if they are part of a faction or guild. Allegiance is not forced.

If not selection is made by the individual, they will automatically inheret the decision of the faction or guild they are a part of. If the individual is not a part of a faction or guild, they will automatically be neutral.

### Autonomy Window

Players have **24 hours** to preserve autonomy by leaving a faction or guild if they disagree with the allegiance of the faction or guild they are a part of.

This is where heated internal political discussions start and end.

### If a Candidate Withdraws

- Factions/guilds/players backing them become **neutral immediately**.
- They may re-declare allegiance once a new choice is made.

## Phase 3: Faction Warfare (23 Hours Before Coronation)

**The Wilderness Runs Red**

- All factions know each other's loyalties (mousing over the character shows they are part of an opposing or allied faction, similar to how factions work in traditional Ultima Online)
- **Violence is legal ONLY outside city walls**.
- **City law still applies inside Britain** for now, as order is still stable.

This works similarly to Faction vs Faction combat in traditional Ultima Online (but with Permadeath and outside of the city walls).

### Goals

- Permanently reduce opposing factions through attrition.
- Force withdrawals or neutralization.

### Withdrawal Option

- Any faction, guild, or individual may withdraw or change their alliegance after a **5 minute visible countdown**.
- After the 5 minute countdown is over, their alliegence changes unless they decided to become neutral. If a neutral decision is made, they exit the Interregnum and cannot participate further.
- Offline players are **prompted on login** to confirm the latest allegiance decision. If they do not confirm, they will be forced to stay with their guild or faction selected allegiance.

---

## Phase 4: City Warfare (1 Hours Before Coronation)

**The Walls Fracture**

### City Warfare Window (1h)

- **Faction and Guild warfare moves into the city, legally!**
- Factions and guilds contest gates, access to the city, and strategic access to the throne room and everywhere they see fit.
- Control is strategic (no hard mechanical gate), but the message is clear: This is a struggle for control of Britain INSIDE the city walls.

### Withdrawal Option

- Any faction, guild, or individual may withdraw or change their alliegance after a **3 minute visible countdown**.
- If a neutral decision is made, they exit the Interregnum and cannot participate further.
- Offline players are **prompted on login** to confirm latest decision, or they will be forced to stay with their current allegiance.

## Phase 5: 15 Minutes Before Coronation

## The Coronation Moment

When Phase 5 ends (after the 15 minute timer expires), The Coronation officially begins.

- The throne room’s relic (single throne) **unlocks**.
- **Any contender** may sit the throne and become king.
- Sitting on the throne for **15 seconds without damage** crowns the King.
- Any hostile action **resets the timer**.

### Allegiance During the Throne Room Window

- Allegiances may **switch immediately** inside the throne room.
- Switching triggers **Oath Lag** (below).

---

## Oath Lag (Anti-Cheese Rule)

When a player guild, or faction allegiance changes in the throne room:

- The switch is **immediately visible** to all.
- Any active throne interaction **resets**.
- The player enters **Oathbound** for **15 seconds**.

### While Oathbound, you cannot:

- Sit the throne
- Contest the throne

### While Oathbound, you can still:

- Move
- Be attacked
- Be killed
- Cast spells
- Use items

### Optional Escalation

- Each allegiance switch resets the timer of Oathbound.
- After the 3rd switch, alliegance is **permanently locked**.

This allows factions, guilds, and players to escalate their allegiance choices to ensure they are committed to the "right choice". It enables last minute betrayals. 

## Law & Crime Suspension

During the Interregnum:

- **No crimes count against participants.**
- Killing rivals is **legal** if they are active in the Interregnum.
- This is justified because participation is voluntary and public, with the rules of this document agreed by all.

Neutral players **cannot** attack, assist, and are still protected by the law.

Neutrals are excluded from The Throne room and cannot enter the castle until the Interregnum is over.
---

## The Interregnum Allegiance Ledger

All actions are **recorded permanently**.

The ledger tracks:

- Who fought
- Who switched allegiance
- Who stood neutral
- Who betrayed whom
- Who killed whom

### Purpose

- Ensures political consequences exist **after** the violence ends.
- Lets nobles purge disloyalists from Courts and legal systems immediately.
- Provides historical legitimacy for future player decisions.

---

## Design Philosophy

- **Violence decides the crown** — not law, not votes.
- **Law pauses, memory persists.**
- **Participation is a choice**, but once chosen, the ledger never forgets.
