# The Social Contract: Civilization vs. Wilderness

Britannia is not a single unified state. It is a **Two Civilizations** system.

The "Crown" does not claim universal dominion over every inch of soil. It claims dominion over **Civilization**. The rest is the **Wilderness**.

Every Guild and Property Owner faces a fundamental choice: **Allegiance** or **Independence**.

## 1. The Two States

### 🏛️ The Crown Vassal (Civilization)
To declare **Allegiance** is to sign the social contract. You voluntarily submit to the King's authority in exchange for the benefits of statehood.
*   **Status:** "Recognized" or "Vassal".
*   **Philosophy:** "I pay for order and access."

### 🌲 The Independent (Wilderness)
To remain **Non-Aligned** (or to Renounce) is to choose absolute freedom. You bow to no King, but you stand alone in the dark.
*   **Status:** "Wilderness" or "Sovereign".
*   **Philosophy:** "I keep what I kill, and I pay no tribute."

## 2. The Trade-Offs

| Feature | **Crown Vassal (Aligned)** | **The Wilderness (Non-Aligned)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Justice System** | **Protected**. Killing you is **Murder** (Red Count). | **Unprotected**. Killing you is **Warfare** (No Counts). |
| **City Banking** | **Access Granted**. Can use Britain Bank & City Vaults. | **Access Denied**. Must use Guild/House Banks only. |
| **Trade Network** | **Full Access**. Can post **Buy Orders** on Global Boards. | **Local Only**. Can sell on Vendors, but no Global Logistics. |
| **Taxation** | **Voluntary Tax Payer**. Accrues debt to Crown. | **Tax Exempt**. Pays only Void Upkeep (if applicable). |
| **Seizure Liability**| **Liable**. Assets can be seized for debts/crimes. | **Immune**. (Except for pre-existing debts). |
| **Bounty Hunting** | **Licensed**. Can collect Bounties & Forensics rewards. | **Unlicensed**. Can kill Reds, but receives no payout. |

## 3. The Mechanics of Allegiance

### Buying Legitimacy
Allegiance is not just roleplay; it is a **subscription to civilization**.
*   **By Guild:** A Guild Leader declares allegiance for the entire organization.
*   **By Household:** A Property Owner declares allegiance for their land and co-owners.

### The Benefits Explained
1.  **The Shield of Law:** If a Vassal is killed, the Crown records it as **Murder**. The killer gains a Murder Count and a Bounty. The Crown enforces consequences for your death.
2.  **The Power of Trade:** Only Vassals can access the **Clearinghouse Logistics**. Non-aligned entities are invisible to the global supply chain; they must rely on foot traffic to their physical vendors.
3.  **The Safety of Gold:** Only Vassals can use the **City Bank** network. Non-aligned players must store wealth in vulnerable Guild Vaults or Housing storage.

## 4. Renouncement & Rebellion

A player or guild may **Renounce** the Crown at any time. Breaking the contract is an act of supreme agency.

### The "Debt Lock-In" Rule
Renouncing the Crown stops *new* taxes from accruing, but it **does not erase the past**.
*   **Pre-Renouncement Debt:** Any gold owed to the Crown *at the moment of renouncement* is **Locked In**.
*   **Persistent Liability:** The Crown retains the right to Seizure for this specific debt forever.
*   **Anti-Exploit:** You cannot rack up loans and then "quit" to escape them.

### "Hard Mode": Renouncing Inside Britain
A player can renounce anywhere—even inside the King's own throne room.
*   **The Act:** "I reject the King's authority."
*   **The Consequence:** You instantly lose the protection of Law.
*   **The Danger:** To the Royal Guard, you are now an armed intruder in the Sovereign's home. You are **Grey (Attackable)** to Guards and Citizens immediately.
*   **The Result:** You will likely be killed and looted before you reach the gates. This is a valid, high-stakes political statement (or suicide).

## 5. Summary
The Crown does not need to conquer the Wilderness. It simply **monopolizes the benefits of society**.
*   Want to use the Bank? **Kneel.**
*   Want the Guards to care if you die? **Kneel.**
*   Want to buy 10,000 Ingots without walking to 50 differents shops? **Kneel.**

Or don't. The Wilderness is free. And the Wilderness is hungry.
