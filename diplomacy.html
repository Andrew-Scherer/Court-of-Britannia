        <h2>What Diplomacy Is</h2>
        
        <div class="quote">
            Britain's diplomatic corps exists to make state intent legible, contestable, and consequential without immediate resort to violence.
        </div>
        
        <p>Where Guards enforce within Britain and the Military projects force beyond its walls, Diplomacy projects Britain's voice. The diplomatic hierarchy exists to carry official proclamations, witness responses, and create the documented record that turns political conflict into actionable consequence.</p>
        
        <p>Diplomacy is not negotiation. Diplomats do not broker deals or make promises. They transmit state intent as declared by the Crown.</p>
        
        <h2>Authority and Hierarchy</h2>
        
        <p>Diplomatic authority flows through appointment and operates through visibility, witness, and protection.</p>
        
        <p>Diplomats answer to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Crown</strong> — Ultimate source of legitimacy and policy</li>
            <li><strong>The High Emissary</strong> — Operational commander of diplomatic efforts</li>
            <li><strong>Envoys</strong> — Regional and factional coordinators</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Diplomats do not answer to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Magistrates (they operate beyond courtroom law)</li>
            <li>Guards (diplomacy precedes enforcement)</li>
            <li>The Military (though coordination is expected)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Hierarchy and Appointments</h2>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Rank</th>

        </table>
        
        <h3>High Emissary</h3>
        
        <p>The High Emissary commands Britain's diplomatic presence, sets strategic direction, and represents the Crown in high-stakes faction interactions. They decide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Which factions receive diplomatic attention</li>
            <li>What proclamations are delivered and when</li>
            <li>How Britain responds to faction provocations</li>
            <li>Which situations require escalation to the King</li>
            <li>Appointment and dismissal of Envoys</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The High Emissary wields soft power — the ability to shape Britain's relationships without commanding guards or soldiers. But soft power creates consequences: a High Emissary can engineer Britain's isolation, provoke unnecessary conflicts, or withhold critical intelligence while claiming to protect Crown interests.</p>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>This is one of the most politically sensitive offices in Britain.</strong>
            <p>A loyal High Emissary extends Britain's reach. A compromised one arranges its downfall.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Envoy</h3>
        
        <p>Envoys manage relationships with specific factions or regions. They:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deliver official proclamations to faction territories</li>
            <li>Witness faction responses and record them formally</li>
            <li>Report faction activities and intentions to the High Emissary</li>
            <li>Maintain ongoing dialogue with faction leadership</li>
            <li>Appoint and supervise Diplomats assigned to their region</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Envoys build personal relationships with faction leaders. These relationships create both leverage and liability: an Envoy embedded with a powerful faction may develop loyalty to that faction over the Crown.</p>
        
        <h3>Diplomat</h3>
        
        <p>Diplomats conduct the daily work of Britain's external presence:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deliver messages and proclamations as directed by Envoys</li>
            <li>Observe and report on faction activities</li>
            <li>Attend faction events as Britain's representatives</li>
            <li>Clarify Britain's position when questioned</li>
            <li>Create the initial contact points between Britain and factions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Diplomats operate in spaces where Guards have no authority and Military presence would escalate. They are the visible face of Britain in faction territories, relying on diplomatic protection and Britain's reputation to stay safe.</p>
        
        <p>That protection is political, not mechanical — if Britain weakens or Envoys abuse their positions, diplomats become vulnerable.</p>
        
        <h2>Core Duties</h2>
        
        <p>The diplomatic corps is responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Delivering proclamations</strong> — Recognition, demands, warnings, ultimatums</li>
            <li><strong>Witnessing responses</strong> — Fealty oaths, refusals, public statements</li>
            <li><strong>Intelligence gathering</strong> — Reporting faction capabilities, intentions, and vulnerabilities</li>
            <li><strong>Maintaining presence</strong> — Ensuring Britain's voice remains heard in faction spaces</li>
            <li><strong>Creating records</strong> — Documenting all deliveries and responses in the Interfaction Chronicle</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Diplomats do not negotiate treaties, make promises, or create policy. Their power lies in making state intent visible and creating the documented record that justifies Britain's later actions.</p>
        
        <h2>Guards vs Military vs Diplomacy: Critical Distinctions</h2>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>City Guards</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Internal enforcement through law</li>
                <li>Arrest and custody</li>
                <li>Restrained force</li>
                <li>Legal accountability</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Military</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>External force projection</li>
                <li>Lethal combat</li>
                <li>Occupation and control</li>
                <li>Strategic violence</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Diplomacy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>External relationship management</li>
                <li>Proclamation delivery and witness</li>
                <li>Non-violent presence</li>
                <li>Protection-based authority</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Key Interaction:</strong> Diplomacy creates the conditions where Guards and Military can act with justification—or makes their intervention unnecessary. When diplomacy delivers an ultimatum, enforcement waits. When diplomacy is attacked, war follows.</p>
        
        <h2>Diplomatic Protection and Its Limits</h2>
        
        <p>All members of Britain's diplomatic corps operate under diplomatic protection — a political norm that makes harming them an attack on Britain itself.</p>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <strong>Harming a diplomat is never "just PvP."<br>
                It is a political act Britain must respond to.</strong>
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <p>This protection exists because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Britain is powerful enough to retaliate</li>
            <li>Factions value future negotiations</li>
            <li>Communication channels remaining open benefits all parties</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Protection breaks down when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Britain is weak or distracted</li>
            <li>The faction sees no value in future dialogue</li>
            <li>The diplomat is caught spying or inciting rebellion</li>
            <li>During total war, when norms collapse</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Attacking a Diplomat, Envoy, or High Emissary creates the same consequence: casus belli.</strong> Britain does not distinguish between ranks when diplomatic protection is violated — all three carry Britain's authority equally in the field.</p>
        
        <div class="quote-simple">
            They are not powerful. They are dangerous to touch.
        </div>
        
        <h2>What Diplomats Deliver</h2>
        
        <h3>Recognition</h3>
        <p>Official acknowledgment of a faction's legitimacy and standing with Britain. Recognition can be Recognized, Tolerated, or Outlawed status. Diplomats deliver the proclamation; the Crown decides the designation.</p>
        
        <h3>Demands</h3>
        <p>Requirements for tribute, compliance, or cessation of hostile activity. Demands create documented expectations — when ignored, they justify escalation.</p>
        
        <h3>Warnings</h3>
        <p>Escalation notices that signal Britain's displeasure and the consequences of continued behavior. Warnings create a paper trail that demonstrates Britain attempted peaceful resolution before resorting to force.</p>
        
        <h3>Ultimatums</h3>
        <p>Final notices before Britain acts. Ultimatums set deadlines and specify consequences. When delivered and witnessed, they remove any claim of "we didn't know" from faction leadership.</p>
        
        <h2>What Diplomats Witness</h2>
        
        <h3>Fealty Oaths</h3>
        <p>Sworn allegiance to Britain. Diplomats witness the oath, record who swore it, and document the terms. This creates binding political obligation — breaking it becomes documented betrayal.</p>
        
        <h3>Public Refusals</h3>
        <p>Faction rejections of Britain's authority or demands. Witnessed refusals become evidence justifying Britain's response. "They never refused" is no longer a defensible position.</p>
        
        <h3>Treaty Violations</h3>
        <p>Breaches of agreements between Britain and factions. Diplomats document the violation, creating the record that justifies termination of favorable terms or military response.</p>
        
        <h2>Relationship With Other Offices</h2>
        
        <h3>Diplomacy and the Crown</h3>
        <p>The King sets policy; diplomacy transmits it. The High Emissary advises on faction matters but does not create foreign policy independently. When the Crown and High Emissary disagree on faction strategy, diplomacy becomes paralyzed or acts without authorization.</p>
        
        <h3>Diplomacy and the Military</h3>
        <p>Diplomats prefer words. The Military prefers force. Tension arises when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Diplomats claim more time will resolve a crisis; Military sees delay as weakness</li>
            <li>Military action undermines ongoing diplomatic efforts</li>
            <li>Diplomats demand restraint; Military demands freedom of action</li>
            <li>Each blames the other when strategies fail</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>A High Emissary aligned with the High Commander presents a unified "carrot and stick" approach. A fractured relationship produces mixed signals that factions exploit.</p>
        
        <h3>Diplomacy and Guards</h3>
        <p>Diplomats request Guards show restraint when enforcing decrees against allied factions or escalate against hostile ones. Guards may comply or refuse based on their assessment of lawfulness and political loyalty.</p>
        
        <h2>Intelligence and Surveillance</h2>
        
        <p>Diplomats gather information through observation, conversation, and presence:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Who is allied with whom</li>
            <li>Which factions are preparing for conflict</li>
            <li>Internal faction disputes and succession crises</li>
            <li>Economic capabilities and vulnerabilities</li>
            <li>Popular sentiment toward Britain</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This intelligence informs Crown policy, military deployments, and guard readiness. A diplomat who suppresses or fabricates intelligence can engineer crises or blind Britain to threats.</p>
        
        <h2>Succession Crises and Diplomatic Fracture</h2>
        
        <p>When Britain's authority fragments, the diplomatic corps faces the same choice as Guards and Military: which claimant to recognize?</p>
        
        <p>Diplomatic recognition is constitutive: the claimant recognized by Britain's diplomats in faction territories gains external legitimacy. If diplomats split their recognition between rival claimants, they prolong the succession crisis by preventing either from consolidating international support.</p>
        
        <h3>Causes of Diplomatic Defection</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>King dies without clear succession; multiple claimants emerge</li>
            <li>High Emissary and Crown issue contradictory policies</li>
            <li>Diplomats assigned to factions develop loyalty to those factions</li>
            <li>A powerful faction offers better terms than a weakened Crown</li>
            <li>Diplomats see current regime as illegitimate or doomed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Consequences of Diplomatic Defection</h3>
        <p>Unlike military coups, diplomatic defection is subtle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Factions receive mixed signals about Britain's intentions</li>
            <li>Intelligence is selectively reported to favor one claimant</li>
            <li>Recognition status changes are delayed or misrepresented</li>
            <li>Faction alliances shift without Crown awareness</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>By the time defection is obvious, Britain's external relationships have already shifted.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Play This?</h2>
        
        <p>If Guards are about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Order</li>
            <li>Force</li>
            <li>Visibility</li>
            <li>Restraint</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>And Military is about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Survival</li>
            <li>Projection</li>
            <li>Lethality</li>
            <li>Strategic violence</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Diplomacy is about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Influence</li>
            <li>Witness</li>
            <li>Records</li>
            <li>Protection</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Diplomatic players get:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access to faction territories and leaders</li>
            <li>Intelligence networks and faction secrets</li>
            <li>The ability to shape conflicts before they begin</li>
            <li>Political leverage without commanding troops</li>
            <li>Protection that makes violence against them politically expensive</li>
            <li>And the long-term temptation to serve factions over the Crown</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>This is the role for players who want power that operates through visibility and consequence rather than force.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Britain's diplomatic corps projects influence through proclamation delivery, witness, and intelligence gathering</li>
            <li>Authority flows through Crown → High Emissary → Envoy → Diplomat</li>
            <li>Diplomats transmit state intent, not policy creation — they do not negotiate or make promises</li>
            <li>Diplomatic protection makes harming any member of the corps an attack on Britain itself</li>
            <li>Recognition, demands, warnings, and ultimatums create documented records that justify Britain's actions</li>
            <li>Intelligence gathering informs Crown policy; suppressed or fabricated intelligence creates crises</li>
            <li>A High Emissary can engineer isolation, provoke conflicts, or blind Britain to threats</li>
            <li>During succession crises, diplomatic recognition becomes a constitutive act that creates external legitimacy</li>
            <li>Diplomatic defection is subtle and difficult to detect until Britain's relationships have already shifted</li>
            <li>Historical precedent: those who control information and witness often control outcomes</li>
