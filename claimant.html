            <strong>Core Principle:</strong> A <strong>Claimant</strong> is a player with a <strong>contested or unofficial claim</strong> to the throne. Unlike the official Heir, Claimants have <strong>no formal recognition</strong> — their path to the Crown is through <strong>conflict, alliance, or seizing power</strong> during succession chaos.
        </div>
        
        <h2>What Is a Claimant?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Claimant</strong> is any player who:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Believes they have a <strong>legitimate claim</strong> to the throne (merit, conquest, etc.)</li>
            <li>Challenges the official Heir or other claimants for succession rights</li>
            <li>Has <strong>NO official endorsement</strong> from the previous King</li>
            <li>Must <strong>prove their claim through action</strong> — military force, political maneuvering, or assassination</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Claimants emerge especially during <strong>succession crises</strong> — when a King dies without an Heir, or when the Heir is weak, contested, or blocked from coronation.</p>

        <h2>Claimant vs. Heir vs. Regent</h2>
        <p>When a King dies, three types of power contenders may emerge:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Aspect</th>
                <th>Heir Presumptive</th>
                <th>Regent</th>
                <th>Claimant</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Official Recognition</strong></td>
                <td>✅ Yes (appointed by King)</td>
                <td>✅ Yes (appointed by King)</td>
                <td>❌ No (self-declared)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Claim to Throne</strong></td>
                <td>✅ Strongest (official designation)</td>
                <td>❌ None (unless self-declared)</td>
                <td>⚠️ Contested (heritage/merit/force)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>King Powers</strong></td>
                <td>❌ None</td>
                <td>✅ Full delegated authority</td>
                <td>❌ None (unless they seize control)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Path to Crown</strong></td>
                <td>Coronation (official)</td>
                <td>Self-crown (usurpation)</td>
                <td>Conflict, alliance, or self-crown</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Legitimacy</strong></td>
                <td>High (King's endorsement)</td>
                <td>Low (no claim to throne)</td>
                <td>Variable (depends on support)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Risk Level</strong></td>
                <td>High (target for assassination)</td>
                <td>Medium (depends on loyalty)</td>
                <td>Very High (outlaws if they fail)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <div class="info-box">
            <strong>📌 Key Difference:</strong> The <strong>Heir</strong> has official legitimacy but no power. The <strong>Regent</strong> has power but no claim. The <strong>Claimant</strong> has neither — they must <em>take</em> both through force, politics, or cunning.
        </div>

        <p>See <a href="succession.html" style="color: var(--accent);">What Happens When the King Dies</a> for the full three-way dynamic.</p>

        <h2>Why Claimants Emerge</h2>
        <p>Claimants arise in specific political conditions:</p>

        <h3>1. No Official Heir Exists</h3>
        <p>If the King dies <strong>without appointing an Heir</strong>, the Crown becomes a free-for-all. Any player with a plausible claim may declare themselves a Claimant and race to coronation.</p>

        <h3>2. The Heir Is Weak or Contested</h3>
        <p>If the official Heir is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unpopular or seen as illegitimate</li>
            <li>Imprisoned or blocked by the Regent</li>
            <li>Killed before they can be crowned</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Then rival Claimants may challenge their right to the throne.</p>

        <h3>3. Merit-Based Claims</h3>
        <p>Some Claimants argue they <strong>deserve</strong> the throne based on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Military prowess or conquest</li>
            <li>Wealth, land ownership, or political influence</li>
            <li>Service to the realm</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Power Vacuums</h3>
        <p>When a King dies and both the Heir and Regent are absent, weak, or killed, the realm enters <strong>Interregnum</strong> — a state of chaos where anyone can claim the throne.</p>

        <h2>Can a Claimant Hold Official Court Positions?</h2>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>🔥 Critical Rule: Role-Stacking is Allowed</h3>
            <p><strong>Yes.</strong> A player can be a member of a Guild <strong>AND</strong> a Faction (which is a layer on top of guilds) <strong>AND</strong> also hold an official role in Court and Crown.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Factions are NOT separate from guilds — they are <strong>voluntary alignment layers that guilds join</strong>. You're a guild member first, and your guild may choose to align with a faction.</p>
            
            <p><strong>This means:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <strong>King can ALSO lead a guild</strong> that is aligned with a faction</li>
                <li>A <strong>Marshal can ALSO lead a military guild</strong> that flies a faction banner</li>
                <li>A <strong>Magistrate can ALSO head a guild</strong> that is part of a religious faction</li>
                <li>A <strong>Claimant can ALSO hold</strong> Marshal, Magistrate, or other court offices while leading a guild aligned with a faction</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>The only restriction:</strong> You cannot hold multiple <em>major court offices</em> simultaneously (e.g., King + Marshal). But Guild leadership and Faction alignment do NOT count as court offices — they're separate power structures entirely.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Why This Matters: Title Stacking as Power Fusion</h3>
        
        <p>In most pre-modern societies, <strong>Claimants rarely stood alone</strong>. They were backed by — and often <em>led</em> — the institutions that gave them power:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Religious institutions (churches, cults, sacred orders)</li>
            <li>Noble factions (dynastic alliances, great houses)</li>
            <li>Military orders (knight orders, warrior brotherhoods)</li>
            <li>Economic guilds (merchant leagues, craft unions)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Holding a church office, faction leadership, or sacred role alongside a court position:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Boosted legitimacy</strong> — "I am not just King, I am also God's chosen representative"</li>
            <li><strong>Neutralized rivals</strong> — Challenging you means challenging multiple power structures</li>
            <li><strong>Framed rebellion as heresy or treason</strong> — Opposition becomes morally wrong, not just politically inconvenient</li>
            <li><strong>Created dual loyalty networks</strong> — Your followers answer to you in multiple capacities</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>⚡ This Changes Everything:</strong> Factions and Guilds can not just vie for control of noble positions — they can <strong>directly claim the Crown itself</strong> while maintaining their organizational power base. This isn't the exception. <strong>This is how power usually worked.</strong>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Historical Parallels: Political + Religious/Factional Fusion</h3>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>📜 The Caliphate Model</h3>
            <p><strong>Caliphs</strong> in Islamic history held both:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Political authority</strong> as rulers and military commanders</li>
                <li><strong>Religious authority</strong> as successors to the Prophet and leaders of the faithful</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Challenging a Caliph meant not just political rebellion but <strong>religious apostasy</strong>. This dual authority made them extraordinarily difficult to depose.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>⛪ Prince-Bishops and Cardinal-Kings</h3>
            <p>Medieval Europe saw numerous examples of religious leaders who also held secular power:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prince-Bishops</strong> — Bishops who ruled territories as feudal lords</li>
                <li><strong>Cardinal Richelieu</strong> — Chief Minister of France and a Cardinal of the Catholic Church</li>
                <li><strong>Cardinal Wolsey</strong> — Lord Chancellor of England and a Cardinal</li>
                <li><strong>Archbishop-Electors</strong> — Religious leaders who elected Holy Roman Emperors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These figures wielded <strong>both ecclesiastical and temporal power</strong>, making them nearly untouchable.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>👑 The Holy Roman Emperor</h3>
            <p>The Emperor was:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Secular ruler</strong> of the empire</li>
                <li><strong>Elected by Prince-Electors</strong> (including Archbishop-Electors)</li>
                <li><strong>Crowned by the Pope</strong>, giving religious legitimacy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This fusion of political power + religious endorsement + electoral backing created a <strong>triple-layer legitimacy</strong> that was extraordinarily difficult to challenge.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>⚔️ Military Orders with Political Power</h3>
            <p><strong>Knights Templar, Knights Hospitaller, Teutonic Knights:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Religious military orders with their own territories</li>
                <li>Answered to the Pope, not secular kings</li>
                <li>Held castles, collected taxes, fielded armies</li>
                <li>Leaders were both <strong>religious authorities and military commanders</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Grand Master of the Teutonic Order eventually became a <strong>ruling prince</strong> of Prussia — merging religious, military, and political authority into one office.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>🏛️ Merchant-Princes and Guild-Rulers</h3>
            <p><strong>Venice, Florence, and other Italian city-states:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Doges and ruling councils were often <strong>heads of powerful merchant guilds</strong></li>
                <li>The Medici family were bankers AND rulers of Florence</li>
                <li>Economic power and political power were <strong>openly fused</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Separating "guild leader" from "political ruler" would have been nonsensical in these contexts — they were the same people.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>What This Means for Britannia</h3>
        
        <p>In Kingdoms of Britannia, this principle creates dramatic new possibilities:</p>
        
        <div class="quote-simple">
            <strong>A King who is also the High Priest of a religious faction</strong> can frame dissent as heresy.<br><br>
            <strong>A Marshal who also leads a mercenary guild</strong> controls both official guards and private armies.<br><br>
            <strong>A High Emissary who also heads a military guild</strong> wields a dangerous combination of both diplomacy and might.<br><br>
            <strong>A Claimant who leads both a faction AND holds a high ranking noble position</strong> has legitimacy (official position) + external backing (faction). This makes for a very politically strong combination to make a play for the throne.
        </div>
        
        <p>This creates <strong>layered power structures</strong> where removing someone from one position doesn't eliminate their influence. It also means:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Coups can come from inside</strong> — Your Marshal might already be a faction leader planning to seize the throne</li>
            <li><strong>Loyalty is complex</strong> — Does a guard follow the Marshal's orders as Marshal, or as leader of their shared guild?</li>
            <li><strong>Exile doesn't work automatically</strong> — Stripping someone of their court position doesn't also remove their guild/faction power base</li>
            <li><strong>Assassination is riskier</strong> — Killing a King who also leads a religious faction creates martyrdom + succession crisis + religious war</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>⚠️ Critical Implication:</strong> The line between "legitimate government" and "faction control" becomes blurred. A faction doesn't need to "infiltrate" the government — its leader can <strong>openly hold both positions</strong>. This is working as intended. It mirrors how real power operated throughout history.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Does This Lead to Corruption and Nepotism?</h2>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>🤝 Yes. Obviously.</h3>
            <p><strong>Nepotism and corruption are inevitable consequences of role-stacking.</strong> A King who also leads a merchant guild will appoint guild members to court positions. A Marshal who commands a military order will staff the guards with their faction brothers. A Magistrate who heads a religious order will favor the faithful in legal rulings.</p>
            
            <p><strong>This is not a bug. This is human nature.</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Corruption Is Historically Accurate</h3>
        
        <p>Every institution across human history has been affected by nepotism, favoritism, and corruption:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Medieval Catholic Church</strong> — Positions sold for money (simony), families controlling bishoprics for generations</li>
            <li><strong>Royal Courts</strong> — Favorites appointed over competent candidates, family networks dominating offices</li>
            <li><strong>Guilds</strong> — Master craftsmen ensuring their sons inherited positions, excluding outsiders</li>
            <li><strong>Military Orders</strong> — Knights favoring their brothers-in-arms for promotions and honors</li>
            <li><strong>Political Dynasties</strong> — Entire families controlling government for centuries (Borgias, Medicis, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Attempting to create a "corruption-free" system would be <strong>historically nonsensical</strong> and dramatically sterile.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Game Mechanics Cannot (and Should Not) Prevent Corruption</h3>
        
        <p>There is no mechanical way to prevent a King from appointing their friends, guildmates, or faction brothers to positions. Any attempt to do so would:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Remove player agency</strong> — "You can't appoint this person" kills political freedom</li>
            <li><strong>Create arbitrary restrictions</strong> — Who decides what is "corrupt" vs "legitimate"?</li>
            <li><strong>Eliminate interesting conflicts</strong> — Accusations of nepotism are dramatic content</li>
            <li><strong>Feel artificial and game-y</strong> — Real power doesn't work that way</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="quote-simple">
            <strong>The point is not to prevent corruption.</strong> The point is to make corruption <em>visible, consequential, and contestable</em>.
        </div>
        
        <h3>How Permadeath Prevents Stagnant Corruption</h3>
        
        <p>The key difference between Britannia and stagnant power structures is <strong>permadeath</strong>:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Corrupt rulers die</strong> — A King who fills court with incompetent loyalists creates vulnerability to assassination or coup</li>
            <li><strong>Networks fracture</strong> — When the guild leader controlling multiple positions dies, their network loses cohesion</li>
            <li><strong>New players can rise</strong> — Each death creates openings for outsiders to break into power</li>
            <li><strong>Grudges accumulate</strong> — Extended nepotism creates enemies who remember when power shifts</li>
            <li><strong>Incompetence has consequences</strong> — Appointing your brother who can't fight makes your guards weak in actual combat</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Corruption becomes <strong>temporary</strong> rather than permanent because characters die and power structures collapse.</p>
        
        <h3>Corruption as Content, Not a Problem</h3>
        
        <p>In Britannia, accusations of corruption <strong>drive stories</strong>:</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Dramatic Scenarios Corruption Creates</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Accusation:</strong> "The King has filled the court with his guild cronies! This is tyranny!"</li>
                <li><strong>Reformer Movements:</strong> A challenger promises to "clean house" and appoint based on merit</li>
                <li><strong>Internal Rebellion:</strong> Excluded nobles band together to overthrow the corrupt regime</li>

        <h2>Resurrection Politics: When the Same Player Returns to Power</h2>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>🔄 The Edge Case</h3>
            <p>A King who leads a powerful faction dies (permadeath). His Regent, Heir, guards, and court are all faction members. His <strong>player</strong> respawns as a new character. At the coronation ceremony, the faction crowns <strong>the new character</strong> — putting the same <strong>player</strong> back on the throne.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Is this allowed?</strong> Yes.</p>
            <p><strong>Is this a problem?</strong> No — if players respond to it.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Why This Is Philosophically Consistent</h3>
        
        <p>This scenario is <strong>not</strong> circumventing permadeath. Here's why:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The character died permanently</strong> — No resurrection, no respawn with same character sheet</li>
            <li><strong>The player has no automatic claim</strong> — The new character starts with nothing</li>
            <li><strong>The faction chose to crown them</strong> — This is an institutional decision, not a mechanical bypass</li>
            <li><strong>This tests institutional resilience</strong> — If the faction maintained total control through a succession crisis, that proves organizational power</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="quote-simple">
            <strong>From Philosophy:</strong> "Death tests succession, loyalty, economic upkeep, and institutional resilience. A guild that survives its founder's death proves legitimacy. A faction that collapses when its leader dies was never an organization — it was a personality cult."
        </div>
        
        <p>If a faction can maintain complete control after their leader's death <strong>and</strong> choose to crown the same player's new character, that demonstrates:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The faction is real, not a personality cult</li>
            <li>Institutional structures survived the death</li>
            <li>Loyalty transfers to the organization, not just the individual</li>
            <li>The player earned that loyalty through past actions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>This is dynastic/factional control</strong> — exactly the kind of power consolidation that should be possible (and challengeable).</p>
        
        <h3>The Critical Restriction</h3>
        
        <p>The philosophy establishes one hard rule: <strong>"No alts holding power simultaneously."</strong></p>
        
        <p>This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✅ <strong>Sequential</strong> — Player 1 dies, then Player 1's new character is crowned later = ALLOWED</li>
            <li>❌ <strong>Simultaneous</strong> — Player 1 is King while also controlling Marshal with an alt = FORBIDDEN</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>As long as there's true death and succession between characters, the system is working as intended.</p>
        
        <h3>Why This Is Politically Vulnerable</h3>
        
        <p>While mechanically allowed, this scenario creates <strong>massive political exposure</strong>:</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Vulnerabilities of "Resurrection Rulership"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Delegitimization:</strong> "He's just a puppet! The faction controls everything, not the King!"</li>
                <li><strong>Target Identification:</strong> Everyone knows WHO to assassinate to break faction control</li>
                <li><strong>Corruption Narrative:</strong> This becomes perfect ammunition for reformers and rival factions</li>
                <li><strong>Weak Legitimacy:</strong> "He died once and they crowned him again? He'll die again soon."</li>
                <li><strong>Chronicle Tracking:</strong> Public records show "Third coronation of [Player Name]" — pattern becomes obvious</li>
                <li><strong>Internal Fracture Risk:</strong> Faction members may question why they're serving the same person again</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Historical Parallels: Dynastic Resilience</h3>
        
        <p>This scenario mirrors real historical patterns:</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>The Medici Returns (15th-16th Century)</h3>
            <p>The Medici family was expelled from Florence <strong>twice</strong> (1494 and 1527), yet returned to power both times because their institutional network (banking, church connections, noble alliances) remained intact. Individual Medicis died or were exiled, but the <strong>family/faction</strong> reconsolidated power.</p>
            <p>Opponents called them puppet masters and tyrants — yet they kept winning because their organizational control was real.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>The Restoration Monarchies</h3>
            <p>English monarchy was abolished in 1649 (Charles I beheaded). In 1660, <strong>his son</strong> Charles II was restored to the throne. Same dynasty, different person. Why? The institutional support (nobility, church, military) never fully shifted. The <strong>system</strong> wanted monarchy back.</p>
            <p>This wasn't "resurrection" — it was institutional resilience.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Soviet Nomenklatura</h3>
            <p>Individual Soviet leaders died (Stalin 1953, Khrushchev ousted 1964, Brezhnev died 1982), but the <strong>same institutional network</strong> (party members, KGB, military officers) controlled succession. Different faces, same power structure. The <strong>organization</strong> outlived individuals.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>In all cases: <strong>Individuals died. Institutions survived. Power persisted.</strong></p>
        
        <h3>When Does This Become a Problem?</h3>
        
        <p>This scenario only becomes problematic if <strong>players stop responding to it</strong>. If:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>No one assassinates the "resurrected" King</li>
            <li>No one forms rival factions</li>
            <li>No one challenges faction dominance</li>
            <li>No one weaponizes the Chronicle against them</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Then the faction <strong>earned</strong> that dominance through player inaction. The system didn't fail — the opposition did.</p>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>⚠️ Design Philosophy:</strong> If a faction maintains such total control that they can repeatedly crown the same player's characters, they have <strong>won the political game</strong> — until someone successfully challenges them. This is not a bug. This is the intended endgame of factional power, and should be respected as such until opponents organize effectively.
        </div>
        
        <h3>The Chronicle Solution</h3>
        
        <p>The public <strong>Chronicle</strong> (death records, coronation records, succession records) makes this pattern <strong>impossible to hide</strong>:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>"King [Character Name A] died [Date], cause: [assassination/combat/execution]"</li>
            <li>"Coronation: [Character Name B] crowned [Date] — [Player Name: same as deceased King]"</li>
            <li>"Coronation: [Character Name C] crowned [Date] — [Player Name: third coronation]"</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This ensures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transparency: Everyone knows the pattern</li>
            <li>Accountability: The faction can't deny it</li>
            <li>Ammunition: Opposition has documented proof for propaganda</li>
            <li>Drama: The pattern becomes a narrative hook for conflict</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Summary: Resurrection Politics as Working Gameplay</h3>
        
        <div class="quote-simple">
            <strong>Same player, different character, repeated power = Faction dynastic control</strong><br><br>
            
            This is:<br>
            ✅ Mechanically allowed (sequential, not simultaneous)<br>
            ✅ Philosophically consistent (tests institutional resilience)<br>
            ✅ Historically accurate (dynasties and factions persisted through individual deaths)<br>
            ✅ Politically vulnerable (creates legitimate challenge opportunities)<br>
            ✅ Dramatically rich (provokes reform movements, assassinations, coups)<br><br>
            
            <strong>The question is not "Should this be prevented?"</strong><br>
            <strong>The question is "Why haven't you stopped them yet?"</strong>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Building Power Outside Britain</h2>
        
        <p>Claimants usually (though not exclusively) build their base of power <strong>outside of Britain city proper</strong>. This is exactly what makes them so dangerous — they're able to organize in secret, right under the King's nose, and eventually make an attempt on the throne.</p>
        
        <p>This is why claimant strategy is deeply relevant to the <a href="guilds.html" style="color: var(--accent);">Guild System</a> and <a href="emergent-factions.html" style="color: var(--accent);">Faction System</a>. Claimants build their power base through guilds (the sovereign organizational structure), and their guild may also align with a faction (a voluntary identity layer on top of guilds). Eventually they attempt to take (or fail to take) the throne.</p>
        
        <p><strong>But here's the twist:</strong> They don't always stay outside. A successful Claimant might <strong>first secure a court position</strong> (Marshal, Magistrate, Regent) while <strong>simultaneously leading a guild that is aligned with a faction</strong>. This gives them both internal legitimacy and external power — the perfect combination for a successful coup.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Outside Bases Were Common</h3>
        
        <h4>1. Exile = Safety + Freedom to Organize</h4>
        <p>If you stayed inside the contested territory, you risked arrest, assassination, or being politically boxed in. Outside Britain's walls, you could:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Raise troops</li>
            <li>Gather money</li>
            <li>Build alliances</li>
            <li>Plan without constant surveillance</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Exile wasn't weakness — it was often a strategic reset.</strong></p>
        
        <h4>2. Foreign Legitimacy and Resources</h4>
        <p>External powers (factions, guilds, outlying settlements) could provide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Armies</li>
            <li>Ships</li>
            <li>Funding</li>
            <li>Diplomatic recognition</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That recognition alone could flip internal loyalties once the claimant returned.</p>
        
        <h4>3. Distance Creates Mystique</h4>
        <p>Being absent sometimes helped. Claimants could:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Avoid blame for current suffering</li>
            <li>Be idealized as a "rightful ruler"</li>
            <li>Let dissatisfaction inside the territory ripen on its own</li>
        </ul>

            <strong>⚠️ The Pattern:</strong> Successful claimants often built power where the current regime couldn't reach them, then returned when conditions favored their claim. Factions and guilds provide exactly this opportunity — external bases of power that can nurture a rival claim until the moment is right.
        </div>
        
        <h2>How Claimants Challenge Succession</h2>
        <p>Claimants have several strategies to claim the Crown:</p>

        <h3>1. Race to Coronation</h3>
        <p>The simplest path: <strong>get to the coronation site first</strong> and crown yourself before the Heir or other rivals.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Risk:</strong> The Regent or Heir may block access to the coronation</li>
            <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Being crowned without legitimacy may trigger civil war</li>
            <li><strong>Reward:</strong> If successful, you become King — even if contested</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>⚠️ Self-Crowning as a Claimant:</strong> If a Claimant crowns themselves, they <em>technically</em> become King — but their <strong>legitimacy is weak</strong>. Loyalists to the Heir may refuse to recognize the new King and rebel.
        </div>

        <h3>2. Assassinate the Heir</h3>
        <p>If the official Heir is killed, their claim is <strong>voided</strong>. This clears the path for Claimants to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Step up as the next strongest claim</li>
            <li>Race to coronation without opposition</li>
            <li>Negotiate with the Regent for support</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Build Alliances</h3>
        <p>Claimants can gain support by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Negotiating with the Regent:</strong> "Support my claim, and I'll keep you in power"</li>
            <li><strong>Recruiting noble houses:</strong> Gain vassal loyalty through promises of land, titles, or wealth</li>
            <li><strong>Public declarations:</strong> Announce their claim in Discord or in-game, rallying supporters</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Military Uprising</h3>
        <p>If diplomatic paths fail, Claimants may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Raise armies to challenge the Heir or Regent</li>
            <li>Siege the coronation site to claim the Crown by force</li>
            <li>Start a civil war to contest succession</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="quote-simple">
            <strong>Historical Parallel:</strong> This mirrors real-world succession conflicts like the Wars of the Roses, where rival claimants (Lancaster vs. York) fought for decades over who had the rightful claim to the English throne.
        </div>

        <h3>5. Delegitimize the Heir</h3>
        <p>Claimants may use <strong>political warfare</strong> to undermine the Heir's legitimacy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"The previous King was a tyrant — his appointed Heir has no right to rule"</li>
            <li>"The Heir is not of true blood — I am the rightful descendant"</li>
            <li>"The Heir is weak and unfit — I am the stronger candidate"</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Claimant's Gamble</h2>
        <p>Being a Claimant is <strong>extremely risky</strong>:</p>

        <h3>✅ If You Win:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You become King/Queen and hold the Crown</li>
            <li>Your claim is retroactively legitimized by victory</li>
            <li>You gain control over the entire realm</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>❌ If You Lose:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You may be executed as a <strong>traitor or rebel</strong></li>
            <li>Your lands and titles may be seized</li>
            <li>You lose all political standing and become an outlaw</li>
            <li>Your house may be dishonored</li>

            <strong>⚡ High Risk, High Reward:</strong> Claimants must weigh the potential for absolute power against the danger of total ruin. Declaring yourself a Claimant is a point of no return — you either win the Crown or die trying.
        </div>

        <h2>Defending Against Claimants</h2>
        <p>If you are the <strong>Heir</strong> or <strong>Regent</strong>, you must deal with Claimants:</p>

        <h3>As the Heir:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crown yourself quickly:</strong> The faster you complete coronation, the less time Claimants have to act</li>
            <li><strong>Secure alliances:</strong> Rally noble houses and the Regent (if possible) to your side</li>
            <li><strong>Bodyguards & protection:</strong> Claimants may assassinate you — stay vigilant</li>
            <li><strong>Delegitimize Claimants:</strong> Publicly denounce them as traitors or pretenders</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>As the Regent:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Support the Heir:</strong> Crush Claimants militarily or politically</li>
            <li><strong>Negotiate with Claimants:</strong> Offer them lesser titles to stand down</li>
            <li><strong>Self-crown:</strong> If Claimants threaten stability, the Regent may seize the throne themselves</li>
            <li><strong>Execute Claimants:</strong> Use Regent authority to imprison or eliminate rivals</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Claims</h2>
        <p>Not all claims are equal. The <strong>strength of a claim</strong> affects how much political support a Claimant receives:</p>

        <h3>1. Strong Claims</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Direct lineage:</strong> Child or sibling of the previous King</li>
            <li><strong>Historical dynasty:</strong> Descendant of a past ruling family</li>
            <li><strong>Popular support:</strong> Widely loved or respected by the realm</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Strong claims gain more allies and legitimacy faster.</em></p>

        <h3>2. Weak Claims</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Distant relatives:</strong> Cousins, distant lineage, or vague connections</li>
            <li><strong>Manufactured claims:</strong> "I bought this title" or "I won a contest"</li>
            <li><strong>No lineage:</strong> Pure merit or conquest-based claims</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Weak claims require more force, politics, or cunning to succeed.</em></p>

        <h3>3. Fabricated Claims</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>False lineage:</strong> Claiming heritage that doesn't exist</li>
            <li><strong>Forged documents:</strong> Creating fake evidence of royal descent</li>
            <li><strong>Opportunistic claims:</strong> "I found a crown, so I'm King now"</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Fabricated claims are the weakest and most likely to be rejected or crushed.</em></p>

        <h2>Multiple Claimants: The Chaos Scenario</h2>
        <p>When <strong>multiple Claimants</strong> emerge simultaneously, the realm descends into chaos:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each Claimant races to coronation</li>
            <li>Alliances form and break rapidly</li>
            <li>Civil war may erupt as factions back different claimants</li>
            <li>The Regent (if any) must choose which claimant to support — or crush them all</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>War of Many Crowns</h3>
            <p>This scenario mirrors real-world <strong>succession wars</strong> where multiple factions vie for the throne. Think of the <strong>Wars of the Roses</strong> or the <strong>Sengoku period</strong> in Japan — endless conflict until one victor emerges.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Historical Parallels</h2>
        <p>Claimant conflicts are rooted in real history:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wars of the Roses (England, 1455-1487):</strong> Lancaster vs. York, two royal houses with competing claims</li>
            <li><strong>Henry VII (England, 1485):</strong> A weak claimant who won the throne through military victory at Bosworth Field</li>
            <li><strong>The Anarchy (England, 1135-1153):</strong> Matilda vs. Stephen, a 19-year civil war over who had the rightful claim</li>
            <li><strong>Sengoku Period (Japan, 1467-1615):</strong> Countless warlords claiming the right to rule, leading to decades of war</li>
        </ul>

            <strong>Summary:</strong> Claimants are <strong>contested, unofficial contenders</strong> for the throne. They have no formal recognition and must seize power through <strong>force, politics, or cunning</strong>. When succession is in chaos, Claimants are the wildcards who can reshape the realm — or die trying.
