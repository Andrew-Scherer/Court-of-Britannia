# 🎨 Decoration System

**Unrestricted and De-Monetized**

---


## The Core Principle


> Decoration is not progression.It is language.We give everyone the alphabet.


## What "Unrestricted" Means

Players have **free access to decorative items**.

Including items often paywalled on other shards:


- Spider webs
- Blood splatters
- Candles and torches
- Banners and flags
- Bones and skulls
- Clutter and ambiance props
- Furniture
- Environmental effects


> **Note**
> **Decoration Is Part of Expression, Not Progression**
>
> Decorations are not:
> - A reward
> - A prestige gate
> - A monetization layer
> - A status symbol
> Decorations are tools for **expression**.


## Why This Is Monumental


### 1. It Removes "Aesthetic Power" From the Economy

On many shards:


- Rare decorations = status
- Status = soft power
- Soft power = influence

That creates:


- Haves vs have-nots
- Cosmetic elitism
- Pay-to-feel-important dynamics

By making decorations free:


> You collapse aesthetic hierarchy entirely.

Power returns to:


- Presence
- Recognition
- Territory
- Reputation

**Exactly where you want it.**


### 2. It Prevents Monetization From Undermining Politics

This is subtle but crucial.

If decorations are monetized:


- The richest players visually dominate
- Political centers look *purchased*, not *earned*
- Legitimacy becomes confused with spending

Free decoration ensures:


- Visual identity reflects play, not wallets
- Faction spaces feel authored, not bought
- Immersion stays intact
- Your world remains diegetic


### 3. It Encourages Shared Spaces to Feel Alive

When decorations are free:


- Players experiment
- Spaces change
- Buildings feel lived-in
- Hubs become social magnets

If decorations are scarce or monetized:


- Players hoard them
- Spaces stay empty
- Expression is cautious


> Free expression = vibrant world.


### 4. It Aligns Perfectly With Removing In-House Storage

This pairing is important.

You removed:


- Functional power from housing

So you must increase:


- Expressive freedom

Otherwise housing feels sterile.


> **Note**
> **This Restores The Balance**
>
> **No power** + **Lots of personality**
> Housing becomes about identity, not accumulation.


## What This Does NOT Break

Free decorations do not:


- Reduce conflict
- Trivialize loss
- Create safety
- Undermine risk
- Affect economy meaningfully

**Because:**


- Decorations **vanish** when property is lost
- They don't store value
- They don't transfer power


> Loss still matters.It just doesn't bankrupt creativity.


## The Sacred Line


> **Note**
> **If It Affects Power, It's Not Decoration**
>
> This line must be sacred.
> Decorations are:
> - Visual
> - Aesthetic
> - Atmospheric
> - Expressive
> Decorations are NOT:
> - Functional
> - Combat-affecting
> - Economy-altering
> - Power-granting

Free access doesn't change this line.  

**It reinforces it.**


## How to Frame This

Some players might worry this is "free stuff" that devalues effort.

The response:


> This is not "everyone gets everything."This is "everyone gets tools to express themselves."Decoration is not progression.It is language.We give everyone the alphabet.

That reframes it instantly.


## Examples of What's Free


### Ambiance Items


- Candles, torches, braziers
- Spider webs and cobwebs
- Blood stains and splatters
- Bones, skulls, remains
- Clutter, debris, props


### Identity Items


- Banners and flags
- Signs and labels
- Faction symbols
- Heraldry components


### Furniture


- Tables, chairs, benches
- Beds, bedrolls
- Shelves, crates, barrels
- Rugs, curtains


### Atmosphere


- Plants and vegetation
- Statues and monuments
- Water features
- Lighting effects


## Decorations Are Temporary

When a property is lost:


- All decorations vanish
- The space reverts to default
- Expression is cleared

This is intentional.

Because decorations are **free**:


- Losing them stings emotionally
- But doesn't bankrupt you economically
- You can redecorate a new space instantly
- Recovery is fast


> Decorations markcurrent occupation,not permanent investment.
