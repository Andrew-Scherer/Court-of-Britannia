## What the Lord of the Royal Army Does

The Lord of the Royal Army controls Britain's external violence. They decide where forces are deployed, define rules of engagement, command campaigns and protectorates, control fortifications outside the city, and determine when military force replaces diplomacy.


> **❗ Note**
> A loyal Lord of the Royal Army protects the realm. An ambitious one doesn't need permission.
> **Historically, Kings fall not when armies lose—but when they stop obeying.**


## Core Responsibilities


### Strategic Command


- **Deploy forces** — Decide where soldiers are stationed and when they move
- **Define rules of engagement** — Set policy for when lethal force is used
- **Command campaigns** — Lead offensive or defensive operations beyond Britain
- **Control protectorates** — Occupy and hold territories under Britain's influence
- **Manage fortifications** — Direct construction and garrisoning of external forts


### Force Projection

The Lord of the Royal Army determines:


- Which external threats require military response
- When diplomacy has failed and force must be used
- How to respond to raids, invasions, or faction aggression
- Where to establish forward camps and defensive positions
- When to request Guard coordination for internal threats


### Operational Authority

Unlike the Marshal (who enforces within Britain), the Lord of the Royal Army:


- Operates **outside** Britain's walls
- Answers to the Crown, not courts or Magistrates
- Uses **lethal force as default**, not restraint
- Functions in environments where law doesn't apply


## Political Power and Danger

The Lord of the Royal Army's power rivals that of the Marshal because they control organized violence external to Britain's legal system.


### What the Lord of the Royal Army Controls


- **Armed forces beyond legal oversight** — Military acts outside Magistrate jurisdiction
- **Supply routes and fortifications** — Can choke britain's external trade and access
- **Veterans loyal to command** — Soldiers follow successful commanders
- **When force replaces diplomacy** — Decides when talking ends


### How a Lord of the Royal Army Becomes a Threat


> **❗ Note**
> A Lord of the Royal Army can undermine or replace the Crown through:
> - **Loyalty networks** — Appointing Captains of the Crown who serve the Lord over the King
> - **Regional power bases** — Building strength in territories far from Crown oversight
> - **Refusing recall** — Ignoring orders to return forces to Britain
> - **Alliance with Marshal** — Combined internal + external force under unified command
> - **Crisis exploitation** — Using external threats to justify "temporary" authority


### Historical Precedent

Military commanders who became rulers:


- **Julius Caesar** — Crossed the Rubicon with legions loyal to him, not Rome
- **Maximinus Thrax** — Rose from common soldier to emperor through military proclamation
- **The Shogunate** — Military commanders became true rulers while emperors remained ceremonial
- **Praetorian Guard** — Military force that installed and deposed emperors at will

**The lesson: Those who command violence often control who rules.**


## Relationship With Other Authorities


### The Crown

The Lord of the Royal Army serves the King but holds significant independent authority:


- The King needs the Lord of the Royal Army to defend Britain
- The Lord of the Royal Army needs the King for legitimacy and resources
- Field operations give the Lord discretion the King cannot easily check
- Distance from Britain creates autonomy that can become independence


### The Marshal of the Guard

**Most Critical Relationship:**


- **If aligned** — Britain becomes authoritarian; internal + external force unified
- **If opposed** — Britain fractures; civil conflict becomes likely
- **If coordinated but independent** — Healthy balance of internal law enforcement and external defense

A Lord of the Royal Army aligned with a Marshal can:


- Suspend courts
- Control access to the city
- Neutralize rivals
- Rule "temporarily" for stability


> History says temporary never ends.


### Diplomacy

Tension between Military and Diplomacy:


- Emissary of the Crown wants time for negotiation; Lord of the Royal Army sees delay as weakness
- Military action can undermine diplomatic efforts
- Diplomats demand restraint; Lord of the Royal Army demands freedom of action
- Each blames the other when strategies fail

A Lord of the Royal Army aligned with the Emissary of the Crown presents unified "carrot and stick" approach. A fractured relationship produces mixed signals factions exploit.


## Succession Crises and Military Loyalty

When the King dies or authority is contested, the Lord of the Royal Army faces the same impossible choice as the Marshal: **Which claimant do the soldiers serve?**


### The Lord of the Royal Army's Decision Shapes Outcomes


- **Supports Heir** — Legitimizes traditional succession
- **Supports Regent** — Enables continued governance
- **Supports rival Claimant** — Triggers civil war
- **Declares neutrality** — Creates vacuum; soldiers often split anyway
- **Seizes power personally** — Military coup; "temporary" authority becomes permanent

**Knights follow the Lord of the Royal Army. When the Lord chooses, military power is committed.**


### Captains of the Crown as Wild Cards

Unlike the single Marshal, the Lord of the Royal Army appoints three Captains of the Crown. During crises:


- Captains of the Crown may choose different claimants
- Military force splits into regional factions
- Captains of the Crown far from Britain have significant autonomy
- One Captain may refuse recall and become independent warlord


## Duties and Limits


### What the Lord of the Royal Army Can Do


- Deploy military forces to external territories
- Establish and command protectorates
- Set rules of engagement for military operations
- Appoint and dismiss Captains of the Crown
- Build and garrison fortifications outside Britain
- Coordinate with Guards during internal emergencies (by request or decree)
- Use lethal force as standard operating procedure


### What the Lord of the Royal Army Cannot Do (Without Crown Authority)


- ❌ Deploy Military inside Britain without Crown permission
- ❌ Override Guard authority within the city
- ❌ Make foreign policy (that authority belongs to the Crown and Emissary of the Crown)
- ❌ Declare war independently
- ❌ Execute British citizens summarily (that requires judicial process)


## Why Play This Role?

The Lord of the Royal Army is for players who want:


- **Strategic command** — Lead Britain's external military operations
- **Force projection** — Decide when and where violence is applied
- **Campaign leadership** — Command operations and occupations beyond the city
- **Political leverage** — Control military power that rivals the Crown
- **Freedom from legal oversight** — Operate outside Magistrate jurisdiction
- **Temptation** — The realization you command more force than the King

**This is one of the most powerful military commanding positions, with potential to rival or replace the Crown.**
