# 🏛️ Guild & Faction Economic Powers

**Organizational Taxation and Commercial Control**

---


## Economic Authority of Guilds & Factions

Guilds and factions possess economic powers distinct from Crown taxation. They control commerce within their territory, set their own tax rates, and compete economically for membership and influence.

Unlike Crown taxation (which applies to all transactions citywide), guild and faction taxation applies only to **commerce conducted on their property** through player-controlled vendors.


## Vendor Sales Taxes


> **Note**
> **Direct Revenue Stream**
>
> Player vendor sales **directly influence guild and faction coffers** through the collection of sales taxes.
> Guild and faction leaders can **set the tax percentage** collected on all vendor sales through the Guild/Faction Leader gump.


### How Vendor Taxes Work


| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| 1. Customer Purchase | A player buys an item from a vendor for 100 gold |
| 2. Tax Collection | Guild/faction automatically collects their set tax % (e.g., 10% = 10 gold) |
| 3. Vendor Owner Payment | The crafter/merchant receives the remaining gold (90 gold in this example) |
| 4. Guild/Faction Treasury | The tax goes directly into the guild/faction Treasury (not Upkeep Ledger) |


### Tax Rate Flexibility

Guild and faction leaders set tax rates to balance competing priorities:


- **Revenue generation:** Higher taxes = more guild/faction income
- **Crafter attraction:** Lower taxes = more appealing to merchants and crafters
- **Competitive advantage:** Guilds compete for crafter membership through favorable rates


> **❗ Note**


## Comparison: Crown Tax vs Guild/Faction Tax


| Feature | Crown Taxation | Guild/Faction Taxation |
|---|---|---|
| Who Sets Rates | King/Regent (via Master of Treasury) | Guild/faction leader (unilaterally) |
| Applies To | All player-to-player trade citywide | Only vendors on guild/faction property |
| Paid By | Sellers (deducted from proceeds) | Vendors (deducted from proceeds) |
| Revenue Goes To | City Treasury | Guild/Faction Treasury |
| Can Be Avoided? | Only by leaving the city | Yes, by joining a different guild/faction |
| Political Consequences | Citywide unrest, rival claimants | Member defection, crafters relocate |


## Why Guilds & Factions Want Crafters

Guilds and factions have **powerful incentives** to attract crafters and merchants into their fold:


### 1. Direct Revenue

Every vendor sale generates tax income. A thriving marketplace means:


- Steady gold flow into guild/faction coffers
- Ability to fund upkeep costs (for factions)
- Resources for military campaigns, property expansion, or political maneuvering


### 2. Economic Power

Crafters provide:


- Weapons and armor for guild/faction members
- Self-sufficiency (no need to buy from rivals)
- Economic leverage (control supply of critical goods)


### 3. Political Influence

A guild or faction with a monopoly on certain crafts can:


- Set market prices
- Embargo rivals
- Leverage essential goods for political concessions


### 4. Population Growth

Crafters attract customers. Customers create:


- Foot traffic to guild/faction territory
- Opportunities for recruitment
- Visible signs of organizational health and prosperity


## Economic Competition Between Organizations

Since vendor taxes directly fund guild and faction operations, leaders have strong incentives to compete economically:


### Strategies to Attract Crafters


- **Lower tax rates:** Advertise favorable economics compared to rivals
- **Protect trade routes:** Safe passage = more customers = more sales
- **Host markets and festivals:** Events drive traffic and vendor sales
- **Recruit skilled crafters:** Better goods = higher prices = more tax revenue
- **Build reputation:** Known marketplaces become destinations


### Economic Warfare Tactics


- Raid rival guild/faction vendors to disrupt their revenue
- Poach crafters away with better terms
- Undercut rival prices to drive customers elsewhere
- Embargo critical resources
- Control trade routes to tax or block rival commerce

This creates an economic ecosystem where guilds and factions compete not just militarily, but **economically and politically** through commerce.


## Internal Taxation & Tribute (Optional)

Beyond vendor taxes, guild and faction leaders may choose to impose internal economic policies:


### Member Fees or Dues

Leaders may require:


- Monthly gold contributions from all members
- Percentage of personal income
- Resource donations (ore, wood, reagents)


> **Note**
> **Important:** Internal member taxation is a **policy decision**, not a system mechanic. Leaders must enforce these requirements through social pressure, reputation systems, or threat of expulsion. The game does not automatically collect member dues.


### Tribute from Vassals

Powerful guilds or factions may demand tribute from weaker organizations:


- Protection money in exchange for military defense
- Trade permits in exchange for access to markets
- Resource quotas in exchange for political support

Like member dues, tribute systems are enforced through **roleplay and consequences**, not automatic mechanics.


## Interaction with Crown Liens

If a guild or faction is under a Crown lien, vendor tax revenue may be intercepted:


| Scenario | What Happens |
|---|---|
| Normal Operations | Vendor taxes flow directly into guild/faction Treasury |
| Under Crown Lien | Vendor taxes are intercepted and applied to Crown debt before reaching Treasury |
| Upkeep Payments | Players can still add gold directly to Upkeep Ledger (lien cannot touch this) |

This creates economic siege conditions: the guild or faction can survive (by paying upkeep) but cannot grow (all commercial revenue seized by the Crown).

## Example Scenarios


### Scenario 1: The Tax Revolt

A guild leader raises vendor taxes from 10% to 30% to fund a military campaign. Crafters threaten to defect to a rival guild. The leader must choose:


- Lower taxes (keep crafters happy, lose war funding)
- Maintain taxes (fund the war, lose crafters and revenue)
- Negotiate (partial tax reduction for members who contribute militarily)


### Scenario 2: Economic Competition

Two guilds compete for the city's blacksmith population:


- **Iron Brotherhood:** 15% tax, Britain-aligned, safe but regulated
- **Forge Masters:** 5% tax, neutral, fewer restrictions

Blacksmiths must weigh revenue vs security vs political alignment.


### Scenario 3: Vendor Raids

A faction under Crown lien cannot generate revenue because all vendor proceeds are intercepted. Members raid rival faction vendors to:


- Disrupt competitor income
- Steal goods to sell elsewhere
- Force rivals to pay protection money


## Summary


- Guilds and factions levy **vendor sales taxes** on all commerce conducted on their property
- Tax rates are set by guild/faction leaders and create competitive dynamics
- Higher taxes generate more revenue but repel crafters; lower taxes attract talent but limit funding
- Vendor taxes flow into the organization's **Treasury** (subject to Crown liens if applicable)
- Leaders may also impose **internal fees or tribute** through roleplay enforcement
- Economic competition between organizations drives recruitment, warfare, and political maneuvering
