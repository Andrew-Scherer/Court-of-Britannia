> This page provides an overview of Britain's Diplomatic organization. For detailed information about each specific role:
> - [[🕊️ Emissary of the Crown|High-Emissary]] — Supreme diplomatic command and strategic direction

> - [[🗣️ Crown Diplomat|Diplomat]] — Entry-level diplomatic duties and field presence


## What Diplomacy Is


> *Britain's diplomatic corps exists to make state intent legible, contestable, and consequential without immediate resort to violence.*

Where Guards enforce within Britain and the Military projects force beyond its walls, Diplomacy projects Britain's voice. The diplomatic hierarchy exists to carry official proclamations, witness responses, and create the documented record that turns political conflict into actionable consequence.

Diplomacy is not negotiation. Diplomats do not broker deals or make promises. They transmit state intent as declared by the Crown.


## Authority and Hierarchy

Diplomatic authority flows through appointment and operates through visibility, witness, and protection.

Diplomats answer to:


- **The Crown** — Ultimate source of legitimacy and policy
- **The Emissary of the Crown** — Operational commander of diplomatic efforts
- **Envoys** — Regional and factional coordinators

Diplomats do not answer to:


- Magistrates (they operate beyond courtroom law)
- Guards (diplomacy precedes enforcement)
- The Military (though coordination is expected)


## Hierarchy and Appointments


| Rank | Maximum | Appointed By | Can Appoint |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🕊️ Emissary of the Crown | 1 | King | Envoys |
| 📜 Envoy | 1 per 10 Diplomats | Emissary of the Crown | Diplomats |
| 🗣️ Diplomat | Un


### Emissary of the Crown

**The Emissary of the Crown is a senior noble position directly under the King, commanding Britain's entire diplomatic organization.** This is not a "diplomatic grunt" — it is Britain's chief diplomatic officer and head of external relations.

As organizational leader, the Emissary of the Crown:


- Sets strategic direction for all diplomatic efforts
- Decides which factions receive diplomatic attention and priority
- Determines what proclamations are delivered and when
- Shapes how Britain responds to faction provocations
- Escalates critical matters directly to the King
- Appoints and dismisses Envoys (who in turn appoint Diplomats)
- Manages the diplomatic hierarchy and delegates responsibilities

**While the Emissary of the Crown possesses all diplomatic powers, much of the fieldwork is delegated.** Envoys and Diplomats carry out proclamation deliveries, witnessing, and routine tax enforcement under the Emissary of the Crown's direction. The Emissary of the Crown reserves personal involvement for:


- High-stakes faction negotiations
- Major ultimatums or recognition changes
- Crisis management when Britain's external position is threatened
- Direct representation of the Crown in faction territories

The Emissary of the Crown wields soft power — the ability to shape Britain's relationships without commanding guards or soldiers. But soft power creates consequences: a Emissary of the Crown can engineer Britain's isolation, provoke unnecessary conflicts, or withhold critical intelligence while claiming to protect Crown interests.


> **❗ Note**
> A loyal Emissary of the Crown extends Britain's reach. A compromised one arranges its downfall.


### Envoy

Envoys manage relationships with specific factions or regions. They:


- Deliver official proclamations to faction territories
- Witness faction responses and record them formally
- Report faction activities and intentions to the Emissary of the Crown
- Maintain ongoing dialogue with faction leadership
- Appoint and supervise Diplomats assigned to their region

Envoys build personal relationships with faction leaders. These relationships create both leverage and liability: an Envoy embedded with a powerful faction may develop loyalty to that faction over the Crown.


### Diplomat

Diplomats conduct the daily work of Britain's external presence:


- Deliver messages and proclamations as directed by Envoys
- Observe and report on faction activities
- Attend faction events as Britain's representatives
- Clarify Britain's position when questioned
- Create the initial contact points between Britain and factions

Diplomats operate in spaces where Guards have no authority and Military presence would escalate. They are the visible face of Britain in faction territories, relying on diplomatic protection and Britain's reputation to stay safe.

That protection is political, not mechanical — if Britain weakens or Envoys abuse their positions, diplomats become vulnerable.


## Core Duties

The diplomatic corps is responsible for:


- **Delivering proclamations** — Recognition, demands, warnings, ultimatums
- **Witnessing responses** — Fealty oaths, refusals, public statements
- **Intelligence gathering** — Reporting faction capabilities, intentions, and vulnerabilities
- **Maintaining presence** — Ensuring Britain's voice remains heard in faction spaces
- **Creating records** — Documenting all deliveries and responses in the Interfaction Chronicle
- **Tax enforcement coordination** — Serving formal notice of tax debts to guilds and factions

Diplomats do not negotiate treaties, make promises, or create policy. Their power lies in making state intent visible and creating the documented record that justifies Britain's later actions.


## Tax Enforcement Through Diplomacy

Members of the diplomatic corps serve as Britain's economic enforcement agents—functioning as both bailiffs and diplomats in matters of royal revenue. This role makes economic pressure visible, formal, and political.


> **Note**
> **Design Philosophy**
>
> **"Tax enforcement is not separate from diplomacy—it is diplomacy backed by economic consequence."**
> By integrating tax enforcement into the diplomatic corps, every player who joins Diplomacy learns how Britain's taxation of factions and guilds works. This creates broad institutional knowledge rather than concentrating it in a single specialized role.


### Tax Enforcement Powers (All Diplomatic Ranks)

**All members of the diplomatic corps possess tax enforcement authority,** but in practice the Emissary of the Crown delegates most operational duties to Envoys and Diplomats. The Emissary of the Crown sets policy and handles politically sensitive enforcement actions, while subordinates conduct routine notices and collections.

Members of the diplomatic corps may:


- **Serve formal notice of tax debt** to guilds, factions, landowners, and other entities
- **Record responses:** acknowledgment, payment, refusal, or silence
- **Apply Crown liens** to guild or faction stones by Royal Decree
- **Initiate seizure proceedings** with guard backing and valid decree
- **Oversee lawful collection** when the debtor cooperates voluntarily
- **Maintain public records** of all notices, liens, seizures, and outcomes
- **Negotiate terms** with debtors on behalf of the Crown (payment plans, partial settlements)


### Tax Enforcement Limits

Diplomats may **not**:


- ❌ Empty faction or guild banks with a single interaction
- ❌ Act without a valid Royal Decree authorizing enforcement
- ❌ Seize property while all authorized representatives are offline
- ❌ Bypass guards—all enforcement requires guard participation
- ❌ Override upkeep payments or drain Upkeep Ledgers
- ❌ Delete, evict, or destroy factions or guilds unilaterally
- ❌ Impose tax rates or create tax policy (that authority belongs to the Crown and Master of Treasury)


### Tax Enforcement as Political Act

Tax enforcement is not merely collection—it is a political intermediary function:


- Communicates Crown expectations to debtors
- Delivers warnings and final notices before force is applied
- Offers opportunities for negotiation before escalation
- Records refusals and denials of authority (which inform future Crown action)
- Creates the documented trail that justifies seizure or military intervention

A skilled diplomat resolves debt through dialogue. A weak diplomat escalates conflict unnecessarily. A corrupt diplomat becomes a political liability.


> **❗ Note**
> "Diplomats are civil faces of authority, not rogue looters. Their role is to make economic pressure visible, formal, and political—not to act as unilateral collectors."

## Guards vs Military vs Diplomacy: Critical Distinctions


> **Note**
> **City Guards**
>
> - Internal enforcement through law
> - Arrest and custody
> - Restrained force
> - Legal accountability


> **Note**
> **Military**
>
> - External force projection
> - Lethal combat
> - Occupation and control
> - Strategic violence


> **Note**
> **Diplomacy**
>
> - External relationship management
> - Proclamation delivery and witness
> - Non-violent presence
> - Protection-based authority

**Key Interaction:** Diplomacy creates the conditions where Guards and Military can act with justification—or makes their intervention unnecessary. When diplomacy delivers an ultimatum, enforcement waits. When diplomacy is attacked, war follows.


## Diplomatic Protection and Its Limits

All members of Britain's diplomatic corps operate under diplomatic protection — a political norm that makes harming them an attack on Britain itself.


> **❗ Note**
> 
> **Harming a diplomat is never "just PvP."
>                 It is a political act Britain must respond to.**
> 

This protection exists because:


- Britain is powerful enough to retaliate
- Factions value future negotiations
- Communication channels remaining open benefits all parties

Protection breaks down when:


- Britain is weak or distracted
- The faction sees no value in future dialogue
- The diplomat is caught spying or inciting rebellion
- During total war, when norms collapse

**Attacking a Diplomat, Envoy, or Emissary of the Crown creates the same consequence: casus belli.** Britain does not distinguish between ranks when diplomatic protection is violated — all three carry Britain's authority equally in the field.


> They are not powerful. They are dangerous to touch.


## What Diplomats Deliver


### Recognition

Official acknowledgment of a faction's legitimacy and standing with Britain. Recognition can be Recognized, Tolerated, or Outlawed status. Diplomats deliver the proclamation; the Crown decides the designation.


### Demands

Requirements for tribute, compliance, or cessation of hostile activity. Demands create documented expectations — when ignored, they justify escalation.


### Warnings

Escalation notices that signal Britain's displeasure and the consequences of continued behavior. Warnings create a paper trail that demonstrates Britain attempted peaceful resolution before resorting to force.


### Ultimatums

Final notices before Britain acts. Ultimatums set deadlines and specify consequences. When delivered and witnessed, they remove any claim of "we didn't know" from faction leadership.


## What Diplomats Witness


### Fealty Oaths

Sworn allegiance to Britain. Diplomats witness the oath, record who swore it, and document the terms. This creates binding political obligation — breaking it becomes documented betrayal.


### Public Refusals

Faction rejections of Britain's authority or demands. Witnessed refusals become evidence justifying Britain's response. "They never refused" is no longer a defensible position.


### Treaty Violations

Breaches of agreements between Britain and factions. Diplomats document the violation, creating the record that justifies termination of favorable terms or military response.


## Relationship With Other Offices


### Diplomacy and the Crown

The King sets policy; diplomacy transmits it. The Emissary of the Crown advises on faction matters but does not create foreign policy independently. When the Crown and Emissary of the Crown disagree on faction strategy, diplomacy becomes paralyzed or acts without authorization.


### Diplomacy and the Military

Diplomats prefer words. The Military prefers force. Tension arises when:


- Diplomats claim more time will resolve a crisis; Military sees delay as weakness
- Military action undermines ongoing diplomatic efforts
- Diplomats demand restraint; Military demands freedom of action
- Each blames the other when strategies fail

A Emissary of the Crown aligned with the Lord of the Royal Army presents a unified "carrot and stick" approach. A fractured relationship produces mixed signals that factions exploit.


### Diplomacy and Guards

Diplomats request Guards show restraint when enforcing decrees against allied factions or escalate against hostile ones. Guards may comply or refuse based on their assessment of lawfulness and political loyalty.


## Intelligence and Surveillance

Diplomats gather information through observation, conversation, and presence:


- Who is allied with whom
- Which factions are preparing for conflict
- Internal faction disputes and succession crises
- Economic capabilities and vulnerabilities
- Popular sentiment toward Britain

This intelligence informs Crown policy, military deployments, and guard readiness. A diplomat who suppresses or fabricates intelligence can engineer crises or blind Britain to threats.


## Succession Crises and Diplomatic Fracture

When Britain's authority fragments, the diplomatic corps faces the same choice as Guards and Military: which claimant to recognize?

Diplomatic recognition is constitutive: the claimant recognized by Britain's diplomats in faction territories gains external legitimacy. If diplomats split their recognition between rival claimants, they prolong the succession crisis by preventing either from consolidating international support.


### Causes of Diplomatic Defection


- King dies without clear succession; multiple claimants emerge
- Emissary of the Crown and Crown issue contradictory policies
- Diplomats assigned to factions develop loyalty to those factions
- A powerful faction offers better terms than a weakened Crown
- Diplomats see current regime as illegitimate or doomed


### Consequences of Diplomatic Defection

Unlike military coups, diplomatic defection is subtle:


- Factions receive mixed signals about Britain's intentions
- Intelligence is selectively reported to favor one claimant
- Recognition status changes are delayed or misrepresented
- Faction alliances shift without Crown awareness

By the time defection is obvious, Britain's external relationships have already shifted.


## Why Play This?

If Guards are about:


- Order
- Force
- Visibility
- Restraint

And Military is about:


- Survival
- Projection
- Lethality
- Strategic violence

Diplomacy is about:


- Influence
- Witness
- Records
- Protection

Diplomatic players get:


- Access to faction territories and leaders
- Intelligence networks and faction secrets
- The ability to shape conflicts before they begin
- Political leverage without commanding troops
- Protection that makes violence against them politically expensive
- And the long-term temptation to serve factions over the Crown

**This is the role for players who want power that operates through visibility and consequence rather than force.**

- Authority flows through Crown → Emissary of the Crown → Envoy → Diplomat
- Diplomats transmit state intent, not policy creation — they do not negotiate or make promises
- Diplomatic protection makes harming any member of the corps an attack on Britain itself
- Recognition, demands, warnings, and ultimatums create documented records that justify Britain's actions
- Intelligence gathering informs Crown policy; suppressed or fabricated intelligence creates crises
- A Emissary of the Crown can engineer isolation, provoke conflicts, or blind Britain to threats
- During succession crises, diplomatic recognition becomes a constitutive act that creates external legitimacy
- Diplomatic defection is subtle and difficult to detect until Britain's relationships have already shifted
- Historical precedent: those who control information and witness often control outcomes
