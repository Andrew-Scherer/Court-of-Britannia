# 🎯 One Faction per Guild Is the Correct Default

**Commitment Over Optionality. Signals Over Noise.**

---


## 1. Factions Are Signals — Signals Must Be Legible

Factions are defined as:


- Banners
- Identity
- Coordination
- Narrative weight

If a guild flies multiple banners:


- Signals blur
- Enemies can't read intent
- Alliances lose meaning

Instead of:


> "They are Orcish Warbanner"

You get:


> **❗ Note**

That weakens politics.


## 2. Multiple Factions Destroy Pressure

The system thrives on **choice and consequence**.

If a guild can:


- Hedge between factions
- Maintain "backup alliances"
- Avoid burning bridges

Then:


- Betrayal loses weight
- Commitment becomes cosmetic
- Factions turn into chat channels


> You want faction choice to hurt a little.


## 3. Multi-Faction Membership Collapses Trust Gameplay

Ask the most important question:


> **Note**
> **The Critical Question**
>
> **If war breaks out between two factions, what does a dual-member guild do?**

Every answer is bad:


> **❗ Note**


> **❗ Note**


> **❗ Note**


> **❗ Note**

Single-faction membership avoids all of this cleanly.


## 4. Distributed Ledgers Become Incoherent

With the Faction Ledger model:


> **Note**
> **One Ledger = Clear**
>
> One ledger near one guildstone → clear signal


> **❗ Note**
> **Multiple Ledgers = Chaos**
>
> - Which banner is real?
> - Which announcements matter?
> - Which calls to arms apply?

You'd be adding complexity for no real gain.


## The Design Principle You're Already Following

The system has repeatedly chosen:


- **Focus** over sprawl
- **Signals** over menus
- **Commitment** over optionality

Single-faction membership fits that perfectly.


## The One-Line Rule You Can Lock In


> *A guild may align with only one faction at a time.Faction alignment is exclusive and voluntary.*

Simple. Defensible. Clear.


> Leaving is instant. Joining is instant.But you can't straddle banners.


## "But What About Mercenaries / Trade Guilds / Neutrals?"

Great question — and the answer is important:


> **Note**
> **They Simply Don't Join a Faction**
>
> That's not a limitation — it's a choice.


- **Neutral guilds** gain flexibility
- **Faction guilds** gain coordination
- Both are valid strategies

No need for multi-faction hacks.


## Final Philosophy


> *One guild.One banner.One choice that matters.*
