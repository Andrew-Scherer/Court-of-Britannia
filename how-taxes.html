        <p class="subtitle">Revenue, Pressure, and Accountability</p>

        <!-- Core Principle -->
        <section>
            <h2>Core Principle</h2>
            <p>Taxation is a system of <strong>pressure</strong>, not punishment. Taxes do not block play. They do not require manual collection. They do not restrict access to goods or services. Instead, taxes convert economic activity into political consequence.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Constitutional Statement:</strong></p>
                <p>"Taxes translate economic life into political cost."</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Revenue flows automatically. Economic behavior shifts naturally. Political accountability follows visibility.</p>

        <!-- Two Types of Taxation -->
        <section>
            <h2>Two Types of Taxation</h2>
            <p>The tax system operates through two mechanically distinct categories. Each applies to different types of transactions and produces different economic effects.</p>
            
            <h3>A. Player Trade Tax (Redistributive)</h3>
            <p>This tax applies to <strong>player-to-player transactions</strong> — trade conducted through vendors, player-owned shops, and direct sales.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Mechanical Operation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tax is deducted from the seller's proceeds</li>
                <li>Buyer always pays the listed price</li>
                <li>The city receives a percentage of the sale</li>
                <li>Final gold deposited to seller = sale price minus tax</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Economic Effects:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prices remain stable — buyers face no surprise costs</li>
                <li>Merchants absorb revenue loss directly</li>
                <li>High tax rates create incentive to relocate trade</li>
                <li>External markets (cities with lower taxes) become competitive alternatives</li>
                <li>Black markets and informal trade emerge naturally under pressure</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This tax mechanism preserves price certainty while placing economic pressure on sellers. That pressure translates into political behavior: lobbying, relocation threats, support for rival claimants, or public unrest.</p>
            
            <h3>B. NPC & System Fees (Extractive)</h3>
            <p>This tax applies to <strong>NPC goods, services, and fees</strong> — purchases from system vendors, crafting material vendors, repair costs, and similar gold sinks.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Mechanical Operation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tax is added to the final price</li>
                <li>Buyer pays base price plus tax</li>
                <li>The city captures revenue before gold exits the economy</li>
                <li>No seller or merchant is affected</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Economic Effects:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cost of living rises or falls with tax rates</li>
                <li>No market distortion — NPC prices are constants, not negotiations</li>
                <li>Primary lever for emergency revenue during fiscal crisis</li>
                <li>Affects all citizens equally, regardless of trade activity</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This tax mechanism functions as the treasury's emergency reserve. It extracts revenue from unavoidable transactions without disrupting player-driven markets.</p>

        <!-- Who Sets Tax Policy -->
        <section>
            <h2>Who Sets Tax Policy</h2>
            <p>Tax policy is shaped through a structured process involving proposal, review, and authorization. Authority is divided between fiscal forecasting and executive decision.</p>
            
            <h3>Master of the Treasury</h3>
            <p><strong>Authority:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Proposes tax rate changes</li>
                <li>Issues fiscal forecasts and warnings</li>
                <li>Provides visibility into revenue flows and treasury balance</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Explicit Non-Authority:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cannot collect taxes manually</li>
                <li>Cannot grant exemptions or adjust rates unilaterally</li>
                <li>Cannot override Crown decisions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>King / Acting Regent</h3>
            <p><strong>Authority:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>May approve tax proposals</li>
                <li>May reject tax proposals</li>
                <li>May override proposals with alternative policy</li>
                <li>Bears full political responsibility for outcomes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Proposal System</h3>
            <p>Tax changes follow a formal proposal and ratification process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Master of the Treasury submits a tax proposal to the Tax Ledger</li>
                <li>A 24-hour window begins</li>
                <li>The Crown may approve, reject, or modify the proposal during this window</li>
                <li>If no action is taken within 24 hours, <strong>the proposal takes effect automatically</strong></li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Silence equals consent. Inaction is recorded as tacit approval. The Crown's responsibility is not limited to explicit decisions — it includes decisions made by default.</p>

        <!-- Automatic Collection & Logging -->
        <section>
            <h2>Automatic Collection & Logging</h2>
            <p>Tax collection is entirely automatic. No player initiates collection. No enforcement role is required. No manual auditing occurs.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How Collection Works:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every taxable transaction triggers automatic calculation</li>
                <li>Tax is applied at the moment of sale or purchase</li>
                <li>Revenue flows immediately into the city treasury</li>
                <li>No delay, no approval, no enforcement action required</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>The Tax Ledger:</strong></p>
            <p>Every tax-related event is logged automatically. The Tax Ledger records:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Current tax rates for all categories</li>
                <li>Daily revenue inflow by source</li>
                <li>Treasury balance at end of day</li>
                <li>All policy changes with timestamps and authorship</li>
                <li>Crown action or inaction on proposals</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The ledger is publicly accessible. Citizens, merchants, and officials may consult it at any time. Political actors use it to construct fiscal narratives.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Design Principle:</strong></p>
                <p>"Visibility replaces micromanagement."</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The system does not prevent poor policy. It ensures poor policy is visible.</p>

        </section>

        <!-- Treasury Flow -->
        <section>
            <h2>Treasury Flow (At a Glance)</h2>
            <p>The city treasury is the central repository for all collected revenue and the source of all fiscal obligations. Revenue flows in automatically. Obligations flow out on schedule.</p>
            
            <h3>Inflow</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Player Trade Taxes:</strong> Percentage of player-to-player sales</li>
                <li><strong>NPC & System Fees:</strong> Premium added to system purchases</li>
                <li><strong>Property Transaction Taxes:</strong> Revenue from land sales and transfers</li>
                <li><strong>Fines and Bounties:</strong> Payments from justice system enforcement</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Outflow</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Indexed Wages:</strong> Daily salary payments to all seated roles</li>
                <li><strong>Bounty Payouts:</strong> Rewards for arrests and enforcement actions</li>
                <li><strong>Other Governance Costs:</strong> System expenses tied to city operations</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>When inflow exceeds outflow, the treasury accumulates surplus. When outflow exceeds inflow, the treasury draws down reserves. When reserves are depleted, salary payments are reduced or suspended.</p>
            
            <p>See: <a href="salary-system.html">City Salary System</a></p>
        </section>

        <!-- Economic Consequences -->
        <section>
            <h2>Economic Consequences (Not Controls)</h2>
            <p>Tax policy produces economic effects. These effects emerge from player behavior, not system enforcement. The tax system does not dictate outcomes — it creates conditions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Observable Outcomes of Tax Policy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost of living rises or falls:</strong> NPC tax adjustments change the baseline expense of daily activity</li>
                <li><strong>Trade shifts location:</strong> Merchants relocate to cities with lower player trade taxes</li>
                <li><strong>Merchant behavior changes:</strong> Sellers lobby for rate reductions, fund rival claimants, or withhold goods</li>
                <li><strong>Black markets emerge:</strong> Informal trade outside official channels gains appeal under high tax pressure</li>
                <li><strong>External trade increases:</strong> Citizens travel to neighboring cities for purchases</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These are not instructions. They are patterns that emerge when economic pressure meets political structure. Players choose how to respond. The system records the result.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Canon Statement:</strong></p>
                <p>"Player trade is political. Gold sinks are fiscal."</p>
            </div>

        <!-- Failure Is Visible, Not Prevented -->
        <section>
            <h2>Failure Is Visible, Not Prevented</h2>
            <p>The tax system does not protect leadership from poor decisions. It does not cap rates at "reasonable" levels. It does not issue warnings beyond what the Master of the Treasury chooses to provide.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How Excessive Taxation Manifests:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Tax rates rise beyond sustainable thresholds</li>
                <li>Trade activity declines as merchants relocate or cease operations</li>
                <li>Daily revenue decreases despite higher rates</li>
                <li>Treasury shortfalls appear in the ledger</li>
                <li>Wage payments are reduced or suspended</li>
                <li>Political fallout intensifies — protests, rival claimants, civil unrest</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>System Behavior:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Master of the Treasury may issue warnings and forecasts</li>
                <li>The Crown absorbs political blame for outcomes</li>
                <li>No automatic rollback occurs</li>
                <li>No safety net prevents insolvency</li>
                <li>The ledger records every decision and non-decision</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Failure is not prevented. Failure is documented.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Canon Statement:</strong></p>
