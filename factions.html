        <h2>Faction Definition</h2>
        
        <p>Ultima Online's map is full of liminal, half-forgotten spaces that are perfect for faction origins, especially for RP shards where "no one officially owns this land."</p>
        
        <p>The faction system works to solve this problem that turns otherwise stale areas into major points of player interest.</p>
        
        <p>Factions can be founded in special areas of the map (such as Pirate Coves, Orc Forts, Undead Keeps, Prestigious and Unique Buildings) to accommodate players who wish to roleplay as different Races or Factions or Guilds or Groups.</p>
        
        <p>Factions function exactly the same as guilds, with the only difference being that the guildstone for Factions is pre-placed in the world map and comes with pre-existing buildings and structures (which are otherwise unused in normal shards) for a faction to occupy and control and call their "home base".</p>
        
        <h2>Faction Relationship to City-States</h2>
        
        <p>Factions may exist outside formal city-state governance or become deeply entangled within it. A faction may come to dominate city-state offices through influence, succession, or force — but no faction holds authority by right alone. All offices remain mortal, contestable, and subject to loss through death, disgrace, or revolt.</p>
        
        <h3>Dual Membership</h3>
        
        <p>Players may hold membership in both a city and a faction simultaneously. This creates the following dynamics:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Informants</li>
            <li>Divided loyalties</li>
            <li>Cultural enforcement instead of hard bans</li>
            <li>RP exile instead of system exile</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Factions may set their own internal rules and culture, but faction law does not override city-state law unless explicitly recognized through political process. Their actions still generate political consequences in the wider world — including eligibility to claim, contest, or seize city-state authority.</p>
        
        <h2>Leadership Requirements</h2>
        
        <p>Factions must have 1 single leader that is named.</p>
        
        <p>Leaders may edit member tags and titles however they wish:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The leader of an Orc faction might prefer to be called a High Warlord, Warboss, or Chieftain</li>
            <li>The leader of an Undead faction might prefer to be called a Lich King</li>
            <li>The head mistress of a Drow faction, the Matron Mother</li>
            <li>The captain of a Pirate faction, Pirate King</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>And so on...</p>
        
        <p>The point is, factions may officially organize themselves internally as they wish, and a single leader is a requirement. Even if culturally they claim to be collective, the leader may function as a figurehead. A designated leader must exist who can be:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Killable</li>
            <li>Summonable</li>
            <li>Held accountable for the actions of the faction</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Faction Mechanics</h2>
        
        <div class="rule-box">
            <h4>1. Property Control</h4>
            <p>Factions control unique property on the map. Leaders set access permissions for these buildings.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="rule-box">
            <h4>2. Dual Membership Mechanics</h4>
            <p>Players can be members of a city like Britain and a member of a faction at the same time.</p>
            <p><em>Example: It is possible to be an Orc that is also a resident of Britain, but players should expect to be exiled from the tribe for such actions and residents of Britain may not appreciate an Orc walking through its streets.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="rule-box">
            <h4>3. Daily Upkeep Requirement</h4>
            <p>There is a daily upkeep gold requirement to keep factions alive. The daily upkeep is dictated by the number of housing tiles the faction controls.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Housing tile price calculation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Housing tile price is dictated by the average price of housing sold in the public market</li>
                <li>Daily upkeep is a percentage of the total price of the total amount of housing tiles your faction controls</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>If upkeep fails:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Property becomes unclaimed and any property inside becomes accessible to anyone</li>
                <li>Player vendors shut down and disappear</li>
                <li>Faction stone resets to unclaimed</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="rule-box">
            <h4>4. Vendor System</h4>
            <p>The Faction comes with a set of buildings with the option to place vendors that can sell whatever items are placed in their inventory. This gives factions the ability to arm themselves with their own supply of faction-specific weapons, armor, and gear.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="rule-box">
            <h4>5. Starting Price Calculation</h4>
            <p>The Starting Price of the faction equals the number of housing tiles the faction controls.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A faction that controls a small hut (10 tiles) will have a much lower starting price than a faction that controls a large cathedral</li>
                <li>This provides flexibility for factions to start as just a few players</li>
                <li>When factions outgrow their space, they can move to a larger area</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="rule-box">
            <h4>6. Guildstone Locations</h4>
            <p>Guildstones are pre-placed in areas where a faction can start.</p>
            
            <p>Expect to see faction guildstones littered throughout the world in places like:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Orc Forts (for Orc factions)</li>
                <li>Bandit Camps (for Criminal factions)</li>
                <li>Caves (for Social outcasts)</li>
                <li>Docks, Coves, and Islands (for Pirates and Sailors)</li>
                <li>City Sewers (for Criminal syndicates or Revolutionaries)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In this way, factions not only provide a unique place for a faction to call home, but also gives breathable life to areas which are otherwise stale and lifeless. This is a win win for everyone.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Clarification:</strong> Faction locations will never be placed in places that are necessary for players to visit for advancement, such as dungeons or other major points of interest.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="rule-box">
            <h4>7. NPC Interaction</h4>
            <p>If a faction is operating in an area where enemy NPCs naturally spawn, NPCs will not attack faction members by default. This provides:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Immersion</li>
                <li>A built-in, simple guard system for factions that are smaller and less defensible</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Faction Collapse</h2>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <p><strong>Economic Consequences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Overreach is punished</li>
                <li>Economic neglect kills factions</li>
                <li>Collapse is clean and visible</li>
                <li>No limbo states</li>
                <li>No zombie states</li>
                <li>No admin cleanup required</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Comparison: Factions vs Guilds</h2>

        </table>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        
        <p>Factions are pre-placed organizational structures with territory, upkeep requirements, and automatic NPC guard systems. Factions operate independently from city-state governance but may interact with or infiltrate city-state political structures through individual member actions. Factions require economic maintenance and collapse cleanly when upkeep requirements are not met.</p>
