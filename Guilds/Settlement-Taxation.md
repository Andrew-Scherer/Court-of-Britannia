# Settlement Taxation

## 1. Tax Authority

* Guilds may set **any settlement tax rate**, from **0% to 100%**
* Taxes apply to **all vendor sales** occurring on guild-controlled property
* Taxes are applied **at the moment of sale**, never retroactively

A 100% tax is allowed and represents fully guild-controlled commerce.

---

## 2. Tax Change Timing (Core Guardrail)

### Tax Increases (Guarded)

> **Any increase in settlement tax is delayed by 24 hours before taking effect.**

* The moment a tax increase is proposed:
  * It is **announced immediately**
  * It is **visible to all players**
  * It enters a **pending state**
* The increased rate becomes active **exactly 24 hours later**

This prevents bait-and-switch taxation.

---

### Tax Cuts (Immediate)

> **Any reduction in settlement tax takes effect immediately.**

Examples:

* 50% → 10% → applies instantly
* 30% → 0% → applies instantly

Rationale:

* No one is harmed by lower taxes
* No exploitation vector exists
* Encourages competitive, responsive governance

---

## 3. Maximum Rate of Increase (Gradualism Rule)

> **Settlement tax may increase by a maximum of 10% per 24-hour period.**

Examples:

* 10% → 20% → allowed (after 24h)
* 10% → 100% → **not allowed in one step**
* Reaching 100% requires multiple days and visible intent

This ensures:

* time to react
* political signaling
* meaningful economic flight

---

## 4. Visibility & Transparency (Non-Negotiable)

Tax information is **public and explicit**.

### Where Tax Info Appears

* Commerce Log
* Settlement Tax Ledger
* Vendor UI (at point of sale)

Displayed information:

* Current settlement tax rate
* Pending tax rate (if any)
* Time remaining until change takes effect

Example:

> **Settlement Tax: 30% → changing to 40% in 18h 12m**

No hidden switches.  
No surprise confiscation.

## 5. Crafter Agency During Tax Changes

During the 24-hour delay window for tax increases:

* Vendors continue operating normally
* Crafter may:
  * withdraw inventory
  * shut down their vendor
  * relocate to another settlement
* No penalties, cooldowns, or lock-ins apply

Remaining after the change is **explicit consent**.

---

## 6. No Retroactive Effects

Taxes:

* do **not** affect existing inventory
* do **not** skim stored gold
* do **not** alter past transactions

Only future sales are taxed, using the rate active at the time of sale.

---

## 7. Design Intent

This system ensures:

* Guild sovereignty is absolute
* Economic ambushes are impossible
* Tyranny is allowed — but costly
* Markets respond organically
* Reputation and flight are real pressures

Abusive taxation dries up commerce.  
Fair taxation attracts it.

The system does not protect players from bad rulers —  
it protects them from **surprise**.

---

## 8. Final Anchor Rule

> **Guilds may set any tax rate, but tax increases take time to take effect.  
> Tax cuts are immediate.**

That's the invariant.
