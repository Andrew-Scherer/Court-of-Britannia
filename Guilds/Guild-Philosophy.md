# 🏛️ Guild Philosophy
**Legacy, Continuity, and Collective Power**

---

## Core Concept
Guilds (Organizations, Religions, or Political Bodies) are the primary way players build lasting legacy beyond a single character's life. 

**Key Principles:**
- **Legacy**: Your accomplishments outlive your character's permadeath.
- **Collective Power**: Territory and commerce require organization.
- **Gathering**: A guild requires property and a **Guildstone** to exist.

## Guild Commerce
Guilds are the centers of gravity for the economy.

### Independent Vending Disabled
**Player vendors cannot be placed on solo or independent housing.** 

**Why:**
- **Traffic Gravity**: Sellers must cluster in hubs so buyers know where to go.
- **Political Leverage**: Guilds provide market access in exchange for loyalty and taxes.
- **Community Building**: Forces independent crafters to align with organizations to participate in public trade.

## Institutional Accountability
To ensure guilds remain vulnerable to political and military pressure, core infrastructure must be **physically accessible**:
- **Guildstone**, **Treasury**, and **Faction Boards** cannot be locked behind private doors.
- This allows **Tax Envoys** to apply liens and **Enemies** to target the stone in war.
