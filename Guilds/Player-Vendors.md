# 🏪 Player Vendors

**The Soul of Local Trade**

---

## Overview
Player vendors are individually owned, location-bound, and manually stocked shopkeepers. Unlike the global **[Clearinghouse](../Economy/Trade-Clearinghouse.md)** which handles bulk commodities, Player Vendors preserve the social flavor of trade and enable specialized shops (e.g., specific armor sets, rare deco, weapon smiths).

### Placement Restriction
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Guild Land Requirement**
> In Season 1, vendors may **only** be placed on **Guild/Faction Property**. Independent housing does not support public vending. This concentrates trade into "Market Towns" rather than scattering it across the wilderness.

## Vendor Mechanics

### Ownership & Stocking
- **Owner:** The player who places the vendor contract.
- **Stocking:** Items must be manually placed into the vendor's backpack.
- **Pricing:** Set by the owner per item.
- **Bank Account:** Proceeds from sales are held by the vendor or deposited to the owner's bank (configurable).

### Economic Integration
Vendors are not free; they are part of the **Guild Economy**. They pay rent and taxes to the guild holding the land.

#### 1. Stall Rental (Overhead)
Guilds charge a **weekly rent** to allow a vendor to exist on their land.
- **Failure to Pay:** If the specific vendor cannot pay its rent, it packs up. The vendor and all items move to the Owner's Bank Box.
- **Purpose:** Prevents abandoned/empty vendors from cluttering the world.

#### 2. Sales Tax (Transaction Fee)
Guilds set a percentage tax on all sales.
- **Deduction:** Tax is deducted *automatically* at the moment of purchase.
- **Recipient:** Tax revenue flows to the **Guild Treasury**.
- **Transparency:** Buyers see the final price. Sellers see the tax deduction in their logs.

> **See [Guild Economy](../Economy/Guild-Economy.md)** for details on how Guild Leaders set these rates.

## The "Shopping Loop"
Because vendors are physical, shopping requires travel. This drives the **Exploration Loop**:
1. Players check the **Global Atlas** (or Discord channels) to see which Guilds are advertising markets.
2. Players travel (walking or moongate) to the Guild Town.
3. Traffic creates RP opportunities and PVP risk/reward for the hosting guild.
