# ⚔️ Guild Interactions

**Simple Mechanics, No Adjudication — Guilds Define Their Own Relationships**

---


## The Core Principle


## What Guilds Can Do

Guilds interact using **direct, bilateral mechanics**:

**Faction membership does not override guild relationships.**

Alignment ≠ behavior. Banner ≠ trust. War ≠ total opposition.


## What Guilds Cannot Do


> **❗ Note**
> **You explicitly do NOT get:**
> - ❌ Binding treaties
> - ❌ Enforced arbitration
> - ❌ Guild courts
> - ❌ Formalized diplomacy layers
> - ❌ Multi-party recognition systems
> - ❌ Fealty trees
> **Why these are excluded:** They would create a parallel civic system, undermining Britain as the sole source of law.


## The Key Distinction

Guilds are **pre-civic**. They existed before law. War and alliance are ancient.

What's missing is not the ability to interact — it's the ability to appeal to authority *above Britain*.


## How Guilds Interact (In Practice)

**Important:** Factions do not act. *Guilds act.* Factions are context, not actors.


## The Relationship Between Guilds and Factions


## Why This Design Works


- ✅ Alliances are real because they're fragile
- ✅ Betrayal is easy and meaningful
- ✅ Power comes from coordination, not UI
- ✅ Britain stays central without micromanaging
- ✅ Players create politics instead of navigating menus
- ✅ "The enemy of my enemy is my friend" emerges naturally
- ✅ Faction banners can mask internal wars or external alliances

**This is how UO should feel.**


## The Clean Rule


## Final Sanity Check


## Summary

Guilds interact with each other using simple, direct mechanics: war declarations, alliances, territorial conflict, economic pressure, and violence. These relationships exist independently of faction membership—guilds can ally across faction lines or war within them.

What does NOT exist: treaties, courts, arbitration, or formalized diplomatic systems. No mechanism exists to resolve or sanitize the consequences of guild choices.

Britain interprets guild actions politically—recognition, toleration, or outlawry—which reframes what those actions mean. Britain is an amplifier and memory, not a mediator or referee.

**Guilds are free to define their relationships. No system exists to resolve the consequences. Britain decides what those relationships mean.**


**Guilds fight. Britain remembers.**
