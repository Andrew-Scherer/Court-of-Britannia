# 🏛️ Guilds & Organizations
**Legacy, Continuity, and Collective Power**

---

## 📜 What Are Guilds?
Guilds (Organizations, Religions, or Political Bodies) are the primary way players build lasting legacy beyond a single character's life. 
- **Legacy**: Your accomplishments outlive your character's permadeath.
- **Gathering**: A guild requires a property and a **Guildstone** to exist.

## 🏪 Guild Commerce (Player Vendors)
Guilds are the centers of gravity for the economy.

### Independent Vending Disabled
**Player vendors cannot be placed on solo or independent housing.** 
- **Traffic Gravity**: Sellers must cluster in hubs so buyers know where to go.
- **Political Leverage**: Guilds provide market access in exchange for loyalty and taxes.

### Placement Rules
- You must be a member of a guild/faction.
- Vendors must be placed within the boundaries of **Guild Property**.
- Independent/solo crafters must align with an organization to participate in public trade.

## 💰 Guild Economy & Upkeep
- **Treasury**: Shared wealth used for salaries, war, and expansion.
- **Upkeep Ledger**: A protected "meter" that must be funded to prevent property decay.
- **Taxation**: Guilds set their own sales tax for members' vendors to fund the collective.

## 🏰 The Public Access Rule
To ensure institutional accountability, a guild's core infrastructure must be **physically accessible**:
- **Guildstone**, **Treasury**, and **Faction Boards** cannot be locked behind private doors.
- This allows **Tax Envoys** to apply liens and **Enemies** to target the stone in war.

---

## ⚔️ Factions (Emergent Alliances)
Factions are NOT a separate organization type. They are **lightweight coalitions of guilds**.
- **Fragile by Design**: Factions have no treasury, no upkeep, and no mechanical leadership.
- **Identity Only**: They provide a shared banner and visual tag. If the alliance breaks, the individual guilds persist unaffected.
