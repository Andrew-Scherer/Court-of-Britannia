# ⚖️ Stewardship & Property

**One Property. One Person. Living Land.**

---


## Core Principle


> *Land belongs to people.Institutions inhabit land.Power ends where life ends.*

Every property in the world is anchored to a **single living character**.

Guilds, cities, and institutions exist **through people**, not abstractions.

This system ensures:


- Permadeath always matters
- Land never becomes immortal
- Power always carries personal risk
- The map remains dynamic and contested


## The One Property Rule


> **Note**
> **Every Character May Own Exactly One Property**
>
> This applies to **all property types**, including:
> - City homes
> - Historic sites
> - Keeps, forts, monasteries
> - Guild halls
> - Any claimable structure
> **There are no exceptions.**

If you own a property, you cannot own another.


## Property Ownership

Property ownership is **always personal**.


- Properties are purchased by **individuals** (e.g. through auction)
- Ownership is tied to a **single character**
- Property **never** belongs directly to a guild


> Guilds do not "own" land.They anchor themselves to land.


## Guild Landholdership


### What Is a Guild Landholder?

A **Guild Landholder** is the individual who binds a property to a guild.

The Guild Landholder:


- Is the legal anchor of the property
- Bears the risk of death, defection, or disappearance
- Has the permission of the guildstone (and guild leader) to make a property a legitimate guild site


> **❗ Note**
> They can **also** be the guild leader, but not automatically.


### Guild Property (Guild-Anchored Land)

A property becomes a **guild property** when a guildstone is placed on it.

Placing a guildstone:


- Anchors the property to that guild
- Designates the property as a guild site
- Binds the steward's personal property claim to the guild

Once bound:


- The steward may not own any other property
- The property cannot be reclaimed as personal housing unless the guildstone is removed
- The steward burns their personal claim to give the guild a home


### Guild Leader vs Guild Landholder

These are **separate roles**.


> **Note**
> **Guild Leader**
>
> - Directs the guild
> - Handles politics, war, diplomacy
> - May change without affecting land ownership


> **Note**
> **Guild Landholder**
>
> - Anchors the land
> - Bears legal and existential risk
> - Creates continuity and vulnerability

They may be the same person, but they do not have to be.

This separation allows:


- Leadership to rotate safely
- Institutions to endure change
- Risk without brittleness


## Co-Ownership & Access

Properties may have **co-owners or residents**.

Co-ownership allows:


- Shared access
- Storage and permissions
- Social and family housing
- Guild member residency


> **❗ Note**
> Co-owners do not anchor land.  
> 
>             Only the Guild Landholder does.
> Co-ownership never replaces Guild Landholdership.


> Access can be shared.Responsibility cannot.


## Guild Landholder Death

When a Guild Landholder dies (permadeath):


- The property enters **Interregnum**
- The guildstone remains
- The property continues to exist
- The guild remains present but unstabilized

This creates a **succession window**.


## Guild Landholder Departure (Defection or Resignation)

If a Guild Landholder leaves the guild voluntarily:


- The guildstone remains active
- The property enters **Interregnum**
- The departing steward has no claim to the property
- Their personal property slot is freed

They may:


- Join another guild
- Purchase another property
- Continue playing normally

They **cannot**:


- Keep the property
- Transfer it
- Destroy the guild's claim


> This is treated as a soft death of Guild Landholdership.


## Interregnum

Interregnum is a temporary state where a property lacks a Guild Landholder.


### During Interregnum

**The guildstone remains active:**


- Residents retain access
- Normal guild activity continues
- Crown standing remains unchanged initially

**Limitations during Interregnum:**


- No major upgrades or expansions
- No ownership transfers
- No re-anchoring or sale actions


> **Note**
> **Interregnum Is Meant To Be**
>
> - A minor inconvenience
> - A succession prompt
> - A political opportunity
> **Not an apocalypse.**


### Resolving Interregnum

Any co-owner who is also a guild member may become Guild Landholder if they:


- Are alive
- Own no other property
- Bind themselves at the guildstone


> **Note**
> **Co-Owner Priority Window**
>
> Co-owner guild members have first right of Guild Landholdership during the **initial Interregnum period (48-hour window)**.
> After 48 hours, Guild Landholdership opens to any guild member meeting the requirements.

Once bound:


- Interregnum ends immediately
- Full functionality is restored
- The property is stabilized


### Failure to Resolve Interregnum

If Interregnum is not resolved:


> **Note**
> **After 24 Hours**
>
> - Global bank access is suspended
> - Upkeep penalties are doubled


> **Note**
> **After 48 Hours**
>
> - Upkeep penalties are tripled
> - Decorations begin to decay


> **❗ Note**
> **Final Decay**
>
> After **7 days** without a Guild Landholder, the guildstone decays.
> - The property is relinquished
> - The site returns to public auction


> This ensures land never stagnates indefinitely.


## Why Guild Landholdership Exists


### Design Reason


> Guilds do not die.People do.

If land belonged directly to guilds:


- Death would lose meaning
- Institutions would become immortal
- Maps would ossify
- Power would freeze

Guild Landholdership ensures:


- Every property is mortal
- Every institution rests on flesh
- Every claim can be challenged


### Technical Reason

Property systems are simpler, safer, and more predictable when:


- Ownership always resolves to a character
- Death, taxes, decay, and auctions follow one model

The Guild Landholder model avoids:


- Dual ownership logic
- Inheritance edge cases
- Guild-death paradoxes


### Soft Immortality (What This Prevents)

If guild leader = land owner:


- Leaders never rotate
- Internal politics freeze
- Assassination becomes the only lever

By separating roles:


- Leadership can change without risking land
- Land can change without collapsing leadership
- Stability and volatility coexist


> Risk is localized, not totalized.


## Final Philosophy


> *Land should outlive leaders — but not people.*

This system:


- Rewards commitment
- Punishes hoarding
- Encourages succession
- Keeps history alive
- Keeps the map moving


> No spreadsheets.No abstractions.No immortal empires.Just people, land, and consequences.
