        <h2>What a Coroner Is</h2>
        
        <p>A Coroner investigates deaths, not people. They document how, when, and under what authority a death occurred. They determine whether the Crown accepts, contests, or ignores witness claims. They examine corpses for method, timing, and signs of authority or tampering. They produce public records that create pressure, direction, and consequence.</p>
        
        <p>Coroners do not validate truth. They document divergence, gaps, and procedural irregularities. They do not determine guilt, block arrests, authorize violence, or prevent executions. They do not restrain power — they ensure power must justify itself after the fact.</p>
        
        <p>A Coroner's authority is procedural and social, not mechanical. Clean assassinations that leave no witnesses and follow no procedure require no response. Sloppy violence, unlawful custody deaths, and procedural failures produce records that inform Magistrates and shape public confidence or outrage.</p>
        
        <h2>Appointment and Independence</h2>
        
        <p>The Coroner is appointed by the King. The Coroner is removed by the King. Between appointment and removal, the Coroner operates with procedural independence.</p>
        
        <p>The Crown is not required to direct the Coroner day-to-day. The Marshal does not command the Coroner's priorities. The Magistrate does not set the Coroner's schedule. The Coroner determines which deaths warrant investigation, which witnesses warrant interview, and which findings warrant public record.</p>
        
        <p>This independence serves the Crown's long-term interests even when it contradicts the Crown's short-term preferences. A Coroner who investigates only the King's enemies becomes politically worthless — their findings carry no weight because everyone knows they are directed. A Coroner who investigates inconvenient deaths becomes politically valuable — their findings create legitimacy because they are not puppets.</p>
        
        <p>Interference with a Coroner's duties is lawful but politically consequential. The King may order a Coroner to stop investigating a particular death. The Marshal may refuse to provide guards for witness interviews. The Warden may deny access to prisoners. These obstructions are acts of power, not violations. But they become part of the record, and their absence or presence tells its own story.</p>
        
        <h2>Core Function</h2>
        
        <p>The Coroner's function is to transform deaths from events into evidence. A body is a fact. A Coroner's report is a claim about authority, procedure, and accountability. The Coroner does not stop violence — they make violence expensive, answerable, or legitimate depending on how it was conducted.</p>
        
        <p>This function operates through three mechanisms:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Witness evaluation</strong> — Determining which claims the Crown treats as credible versus insufficient</li>
            <li><strong>Forensic examination</strong> — Extracting method, timing, and authority indicators from corpses</li>
            <li><strong>Public documentation</strong> — Publishing findings that inform Magistrates and public judgment</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Coroners do not prevent killings. They ensure killings that cannot justify themselves produce political cost. This makes careful violence survivable and careless violence dangerous, without prohibiting either.</p>
        
        <h2>Witness Testimony and Claims</h2>
        
        <p>A Coroner may interview witnesses and choose whether to include their testimony in investigation reports. When multiple witnesses provide contradictory accounts, the Coroner documents the divergence rather than determining truth. The existence of conflicting accounts becomes the finding itself — the Magistrate may later adjudicate credibility, but the Coroner establishes that the conflict exists.</p>
        
        <h2>Custody and Execution Review</h2>
        
        <p>Any death occurring in jail, under guard escort, during questioning, during riot suppression, or during an alleged execution becomes a Coroner concern socially, not mechanically. The Coroner does not block these actions. The Coroner ensures they must answer for themselves afterward.</p>
        
        <p>For custody deaths, the Coroner may ask:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Who ordered the action that led to the death?</li>
            <li>Who carried it out?</li>
            <li>Under what authority was it undertaken?</li>
            <li>Were required roles present? (Executioner for executions, Magistrate for sentencing, etc.)</li>
            <li>What witnesses observed the event?</li>
            <li>What forensic evidence supports or contradicts the stated cause?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Missing links are documented as procedural irregularities. A prisoner who dies during questioning when no Magistrate authorized interrogation creates a gap. A prisoner who dies "resisting arrest" when multiple witnesses describe a beating creates a divergence. An execution carried out without an Executioner creates a procedural failure.</p>
        
        <p>These irregularities do not automatically result in charges or dismissals. They create records that the Magistrate and public use to form judgments. A single irregular custody death may be overlooked as tragic but excusable. A pattern of irregular custody deaths becomes evidence of systemic abuse or regime brutality.</p>
        
        <h3>Clean Versus Sloppy Authority</h3>
        
        <p>A guard who subdues a prisoner, transports them to jail, turns them over to the Warden, and logs the arrest has acted cleanly. If the prisoner later dies in custody under Warden supervision with Magistrate and Executioner present, the death is procedurally sound. The Coroner documents this. The record supports the regime's legitimacy.</p>
        
        <p>A guard who kills a prisoner during transport, claims they "resisted," and provides no witnesses has acted sloppily. The Coroner documents the absence of procedure. The record creates suspicion. Repeated occurrences damage the regime's claim to lawful authority.</p>
        
        <p>The system rewards precision and punishes carelessness without prohibiting force. This ensures competent regimes maintain legitimacy while incompetent ones create evidence of their own failures.</p>
        
        <h2>Procedural Irregularities</h2>
        
        <p>A procedural irregularity is a death that lacks expected authority, testimony, or presence of required roles. Irregularities are not crimes. They are gaps between how authority claims to operate and how it actually operated in a specific instance.</p>
        
        <p>Examples of procedural irregularities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Execution without Magistrate sentencing</li>
            <li>Execution without Executioner present</li>
            <li>Custody death with no witnesses</li>
            <li>Arrest followed by immediate death with no transport to jail</li>
            <li>Guard killing with conflicting or absent justification</li>
            <li>Prisoner vanishing from custody without release order or execution record</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Coroner does not block arrests or executions based on procedural gaps. The Coroner makes sloppy or unlawful violence expensive after the fact. Irregularities feed Magistrates who may charge guards with murder and public perception that determines whether a regime is lawful or brutal.</p>
        
        <p>A regime that accumulates procedural irregularities creates its own opposition. Guards who kill without justification create martyrs. Wardens who lose prisoners create rumors of torture or murder. Executions without proper roles present create questions about legitimacy. These questions do not mechanically weaken the regime, but they weaken its political foundation.</p>
        
        <h2>Interaction with Other Powers</h2>
        
        <p>The Coroner exists in tension with multiple authorities, each of which operates on different timescales and with different goals.</p>
        
        <h3>Coroner vs. Marshal</h3>
        <p>The Marshal prioritizes speed, order, and control. The Coroner prioritizes daylight, documentation, and accountability. When a guard kills during an arrest, the Marshal evaluates whether the guard followed orders and maintained control. The Coroner evaluates whether the killing was justified, witnessed, and procedurally sound. These evaluations may reach opposite conclusions.</p>
        
        <p>The Marshal cannot prevent Coroner investigation, but the Marshal can slow it, deny resources, or refuse to discipline guards the Coroner finds at fault. The Coroner cannot command guards, but the Coroner can publish findings that make continued employment of a brutal guard politically untenable.</p>
        
        <h3>Coroner vs. Magistrate</h3>
        <p>The Coroner provides documentation; the Magistrate adjudicates. A Coroner's finding of procedural irregularity does not automatically result in charges — the Magistrate decides whether to prosecute. A Magistrate's ruling that a death was murder does not require Coroner agreement — the Magistrate weighs evidence and makes legal judgments.</p>
        
        <p>However, Magistrates rely on Coroner findings as primary evidence. A Magistrate who ignores repeated Coroner findings of guard misconduct becomes complicit in the regime's failures. A Magistrate who charges guards based on incomplete Coroner investigation risks wrongful prosecution.</p>
        
        <h3>Coroner vs. Crown</h3>
        <p>The Coroner is appointed by the King and serves the King's long-term interests in legitimacy. This does not mean the Coroner serves the King's short-term interests in avoiding scrutiny. A King who appoints a Coroner gains legitimacy by demonstrating that deaths are investigated rather than ignored. A King who removes a Coroner for investigating inconvenient deaths loses that legitimacy.</p>
        
        <p>The Crown's relationship with the Coroner is inherently paradoxical: the Coroner's value derives from independence, but independence means the Coroner cannot be controlled. A King who wants the benefits of accountability must accept the costs of scrutiny.</p>
        
        <h3>No Role Outranks the Coroner Procedurally — Only Politically</h3>
        
        <p>The Marshal cannot order a Coroner to stop investigating. The Magistrate cannot dismiss a Coroner's findings. But the King can remove the Coroner. This removal is an act of political power with political consequences.</p>
        
        <h2>Public Death Ledger</h2>
        
        <p>Coroners interact with the <a href="death-ledger.html" style="color: var(--accent);">Public Death Ledger</a> through two primary mechanisms:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Forensic examination</strong> — When a Coroner examines a corpse, the ledger automatically updates with forensic indicators (method, timing, authority signals, tampering evidence). These updates are factual and non-narrative.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Coroner addenda</strong> — At their discretion, Coroners may publish narrative reports containing witness testimony, procedural assessments, and personal judgment. Multiple Coroners may publish conflicting addenda for the same death. The ledger preserves all interpretations without resolving disputes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>→ See <a href="death-ledger.html" style="color: var(--accent);">Public Death Ledger</a> for the complete three-layer system, automatic baseline recording, ledger states, access rules, and political impact</strong></p>
        
        <h2>Forensic Evaluation</h2>
        
        <p>When a Coroner examines a corpse, they extract information without requiring witnesses or confessions. Forensic evaluation provides:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Method identification</strong> — Sharp weapon, blunt weapon, piercing weapon, poison, magic, strangulation, blunt force trauma</li>
            <li><strong>Trauma patterns</strong> — Single strike versus sustained beating, defensive wounds, execution-style killing</li>
            <li><strong>Timing estimation</strong> — Hours or days since death occurred</li>
            <li><strong>Authority indicators</strong> — Restraints, custody marks, execution procedures, presence of official seals or tags</li>
            <li><strong>Tampering evidence</strong> — Post-mortem looting, body moved, wounds inflicted after death, attempts to conceal cause</li>
            <li><strong>Capability signals</strong> — Trained versus untrained strikes, surgical precision versus brutality, arcane signatures</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Forensic findings do not name killers. They provide direction for investigation. A corpse showing trained blade work narrows suspects to those with martial training. A corpse showing custody marks directs suspicion toward guards or Warden. A corpse showing arcane residue suggests magical involvement.</p>
        
        <p>Clean assassinations that leave minimal forensic evidence are rewarded: they provide less information for Coroners to document and fewer leads for Magistrates to follow. Brutal, careless killings provide abundant evidence and clear patterns.</p>
        
        <h2>Absence, Bias, and Political Consequence</h2>
        
        <p>Coroner absence does not halt gameplay. It creates a procedural vacuum that other forces fill unpredictably.</p>
        
        <h3>Effects of Coroner Absence</h3>
        
        <p>When no Coroner is appointed or the appointed Coroner is inactive:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deaths still create baseline ledger entries</li>
            <li>No forensic evaluation occurs; corpses decay without examination</li>
            <li>Witness claims go unevaluated; rumors spread unchecked</li>
            <li>Guard abuses escalate without documentation</li>
            <li>Magistrates lack primary evidence for trials</li>
            <li>Public perception fills the gap with assumption and rumor</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Coroner absence makes violence cheaper in the short term and more politically dangerous in the long term. Without investigation, brutal regimes operate freely. Without documentation, those regimes cannot prove their violence was justified when legitimacy is later questioned.</p>
        
        <h3>Bias as Legitimate Gameplay</h3>
        
        <p>Coroners are not required to be neutral. A Coroner may engage in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Selective investigation</strong> — Prioritizing deaths of nobles over commoners, allies over enemies</li>
            <li><strong>Ignored deaths</strong> — Choosing not to investigate certain killings despite witness claims</li>
            <li><strong>Focused scrutiny</strong> — Investigating every death involving a particular guard, house, or official</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This bias is politically legitimate but politically dangerous. A Coroner who only investigates deaths that embarrass the King's enemies becomes a partisan tool. Their findings lose credibility. When they later investigate a death that matters, no one believes them.</p>
        
        <p>A Coroner who investigates all custody deaths regardless of politics becomes valuable. Their findings carry weight because they are not selective. This value comes with risk: the Coroner will inevitably produce findings the Crown dislikes. The Crown must then choose between protecting the Coroner's independence or removing them and losing credibility.</p>
        
        <h3>Political Consequence of Coroner Findings</h3>
        
        <p>A Coroner's findings do not mechanically punish anyone. They create political pressure that other actors may respond to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Magistrates</strong> may charge guards or officials based on Coroner findings</li>
            <li><strong>The King</strong> may dismiss guards or officials to demonstrate accountability</li>
            <li><strong>Opposition houses</strong> may use Coroner findings as evidence of regime illegitimacy</li>
            <li><strong>The public</strong> may lose confidence in a regime that ignores repeated findings of misconduct</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Coroner creates the ammunition. Other actors decide whether to use it.</p>
        
        <div class="quote-simple">
            Coroners do not restrain the Guard.<br>
            They ensure the Guard must answer for itself.<br>
            Force that cannot justify itself becomes illegitimate.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Coroners investigate deaths, not people; they document method, authority, and procedural gaps without determining guilt</li>
            <li>Appointed and removed by the King; operate with procedural independence between appointment and removal</li>
            <li>Coroners evaluate witness claims as accepted, contested, or ignored — this is sufficiency judgment, not truth determination</li>
            <li>Deaths in custody, during arrest, or during executions trigger Coroner review of authority, roles present, and procedural compliance</li>
            <li>Procedural irregularities make sloppy violence politically expensive without mechanically blocking it</li>
            <li>The Public Death Ledger operates in three layers: automatic baseline, forensic update, and optional Coroner addendum</li>
            <li>Forensic examination provides method, timing, authority signals, and capability hints without naming killers</li>
            <li>Coroner absence allows violence to proceed unchecked but creates long-term legitimacy risk when accountability is later demanded</li>
            <li>Coroner bias is legitimate gameplay that creates political enemies and credibility risk</li>
            <li>Coroners interact with Marshals (speed vs. daylight), Magistrates (documentation vs. adjudication), and Crown (independence vs. control)</li>
            <li>No role outranks the Coroner procedurally; only the King can remove them, which is an act of political power with political cost</li>
            <li>Clean violence leaves minimal forensic trail and requires no response; careless violence creates abundant evidence and patterns</li>
        </ul>
