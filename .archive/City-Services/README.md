**Replaced by:** `City-Services/Fast-Travel.md`

### Fast-Travel-Revamp.md
- **Purpose:** Philosophical principles document for travel design
- **Status:** Principles consolidated into unified Fast-Travel.md

### Fast-Travel-System.md
- **Purpose:** Detailed implementation with cargo anchoring system
- **Status:** Implementation details consolidated into unified Fast-Travel.md

**Reason for consolidation:**
- Removed hauling from Season 1, making cargo restrictions unnecessary
- Created single source of truth that simplifies for Season 1 while preserving cargo anchoring design for future seasons
- Eliminated confusion between two overlapping documents
