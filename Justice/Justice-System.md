# ⚖️ Justice System
**Crime, Punishment, and Political Bloodshed**

---

## 📜 The Justice Philosophy
This is not a punishment system; it is a **political weapon**. Justice is player-driven, consequences are permanent, and the only absolution is power.

### One-Murder Red Status
Kingdoms of Britannia follows a "Hardcore" philosophy: **One murder equals Red status forever.** There are no murder-count thresholds and no automated pardons.

## 🚔 Crime Classification

### 1. Grey Crimes (Minor/Arrestable)
**Crimes**: Theft, Robbery (looting downed players), Assault, Pet Killing.
- **Status**: Grey Flag (persistent until resolved).
- **Consequence**: Attackable by all. Can be arrested.
- **Resolution**: **Asset Recovery** or **Jail**.
    - **Asset Recovery**: Upon arrest, the fine is deducted instantly from the criminal's bank.
    - **Insolvency**: If `Bank Gold < Fine`, the unpaid debt is converted to **Jail Time**.
    - **Result**: Immediate release (if rich) or Labor Sentence (if poor). No lingering debt.

> **Jurisdiction Note:** These acts are only "Crimes" if committed against a **Crown Citizen/Vassal** or on **Crown Property**. In the Wilderness against Non-Aligned entities, these are simply acts of aggression.

### 2. Red Crimes (Capital/Execution)
**Crime**: **Murder** (causing character permadeath).
- **The Golden Rule of Law**: "A Crime is defined by the Victim."
    - **Victim is Crown Vassal:** **MURDER**. The Crown records the crime. Killer gains a Murder Count.
    - **Victim is Non-Aligned:** **WARFARE**. The Crown does not care. No Murder Count. No Bounty.
- **Status**: **Red Flag (Permanent)**.
- **Consequence**: Kill on Sight by Guards and players globally. Denied all city services.
- **Resolution**: **Execution (Permadeath)** or Coronation Amnesty.

> **War Exception**: Murder committed during a **mutually declared guild war** is treated as wartime combat, not a criminal act. One-sided war declarations do **not** provide legal cover (unless the victim is Non-Aligned, in which case cover is not needed).

---

## 🔍 Forensic Investigation
"Without investigation, murder is just a rumor." Evidence is perishable and must be collected by an expert.

- **Forensic Skill**: Determines the detail retrieved from a corpse:
    - **0-30**: Basic cause ("Blunt force").
    - **31-60**: Weapon & Time ("War hammer, approx 2 hours ago").
    - **61-90**: Killer Identity ("Killed by [Name]").
    - **91-100**: Tracking Data ("Killer is heading North").
- **Variable Decay (The Forensic Window)**:
    - **Crown-Aligned Corpse**: Persists for **24 Hours**. (Forensics possible).
    - **Non-Aligned Corpse**: Fast Decay (**15 Minutes**). (No forensics needed as no bounty applies).
    - *Why?* Only Crown deaths require investigation for Bounties. Wilderness deaths are just meat.
- **The Economy of Truth**: Investigators receive **25% of the bounty pot** when the criminal they identified is eventually caught and executed.

---

## ⚔️ The Bounty Economy (Licensed Execution)
Bounty hunting is a for-profit profession. The Crown creates a market for the heads of its enemies.

### 1. The Accumulation (The Pot)
Bounties are **Victim-Funded**. The Crown does not subsidize revenge.

- **Victim Liens**: Gold is extracted from the victim's bank at death based on Legitimacy Tiers.
- **Forensic Requirement**: Bounties are only **Activated** if a Forensic Investigator solves the crime. Unsolved crimes generate 0gp.

### 2. Collection
- **Grey Criminals**: Must be **Arrested** using [Shackles]. Bounty paid on delivery to Britain Jail.
- **Red Criminals**: Must be **Executed**. Bounty paid on turn-in of the criminal's **Head** to the Bounty Clerk.

---

## 🩸 Infamy Titles (The Matrix)
Reputation is a combination of your **Soul** (Crimes) and your **Notoriety** (Bounty Rank).

| Bounty Rank → | **Unknown** | **Top 100** | **Top 50** | **Top 10** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Criminal (Grey)** | Rude | Disreputable | Notorious | **Dishonored Lord** |
| **Murderer (Red)** | Despicable | Wicked | Nefarious | **Dread Lord** |

---

## 👑 Coronation Amnesty
The only mechanical way to clear a Red status is to **seize the throne**.

- **The Act**: A successful Coronation Ceremony clears **ALL** prior criminal statuses for the new King and their guild.
- **The Risk**: This is a public event. Bounty hunters and rivals can attack during the 15-30 minute ceremony window.
- **The Result**: Death during the ceremony is Permadeath (for Reds). Success is total legal absolution.

---

## 🚧 Wrongful Execution
Executing a **Grey** criminal is an act of **Murder**. 
- Bounty Hunters who kill Greys instead of arresting them will be flagged **Red** themselves once the forensic report is filed.

## 🏛️ Harboring & Revocation

Britain does not prosecute guilds for individual crimes by default. However, **a personal crime can become a guild crime** if the institution protects, hides, or harbors the offender.

### Defining "Harboring"
Harboring is defined as an organization providing any of the following to a **Red** or **Persistent Grey** player:
- **Residency**: Housing within the guild's controlled property.
- **Economic Access**: Vendor placement or shop management rights.
- **Civic Standing**: Appointing the criminal to a role or office within the organization.

### The Revocation Process
1. **The Proof**: Evidence of harboring (Forensic Reports, Witness Testimony) is presented to the Crown.
2. **The Warning**: The Crown issues a **Formal Notice of Revocation** via Royal Decree.
3. **The 24-Hour Window**: The guild has 24 hours to "Cleanse" the criminal (ensure arrest or physical eviction from organizational roles).
4. **Conclusion**: If the criminal remains protected, the guild’s status is dropped to **Outlawed**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Civic vs. Territorial Jurisdiction**: The Crown can only mechanically evict criminals from **Britain-controlled civic spaces** (Residency, city property, city roles). Outside Britain, the Crown cannot evict; it can only withdraw recognition or outlaw the guild harboring the criminal.

### Mechanical Powers (Civic Enforcement)
These are the only **system-level levers** Britain can pull in response to harboring:
- **Recognition Change**: Recognized → Tolerated → Outlawed.
- **Civic Access Removal**: Britain vendors, markets, housing, storage, and public roles.
- **Warrants & Ledger Entries**: Public warnings, warrants, and recorded decrees.

These powers are **discretionary**. A King may choose not to enforce them — but the political record still exists.

---

## 🩸 Organizational Consequence
When harboring is proven and the window expires, Britain treats the guild itself as the liable party:
- **Revocation of Recognition**: Guild status drops to **Outlawed**.
- **Economic Siege**: Immediate application of [Crown Liens] to the guild treasury.
- **Enforcement Window**: The Marshal may authorize the seizure of all guild assets.
