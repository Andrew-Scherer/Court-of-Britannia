# 🔒 Jail System (Correction)

**For Citizens Who Make Mistakes. Not For Killers.**

---

> *Jail isn't a dungeon. It's a workplace. You owe a debt to society, and you will pay it in sweat.*

## Core Philosophy: Time is Currency
Jail is the backstop for criminals who cannot pay their debts.
*   **The Goal**: Resolution of Grey Status.
*   **The Method**: **Asset Recovery** or **Incarceration**.
*   **The Result**: The player returns to society with a clean slate.

## 1. The Jail Sentence (Debt Replacement)
When a Grey Criminal is caught, the system attempts **Asset Recovery** (paying the fine from their bank).
*   **If Bank >= Fine**: The fine is paid. **No Jail**.
*   **If Bank < Fine**: The unpaid portion is converted to **Jail Time**.

### The Mechanic
*   **Conversion Rate**: 1 Minute per X Gold of unpaid fine.
*   **No AFK Check**: The punishment is the removed access to the world, not the labor.
*   **No Bail**: You are here because you *could not* pay bail (the fine). You cannot pay your way out now.

---

## 2. Why "Time" Works
*   **No Farming**: Breaking the law on an alt with 0 gold results in maximum jail time. It is not "free griefing".
*   **No Debt**: When you leave, you are free. You do not owe the Crown anything.
*   **Economic Reality**: If you are rich, you lose gold. If you are poor, you lose time. Crime always costs *something*.

## 3. Contraband & The Jail Economy

Because players are physically active in jail, a micro-economy emerges.

*   **Smuggling:** Visitors can pass small items (lockpicks, food, shivs) through the bars.
*   **The Black Market:** Prisoners trade labor tokens or contraband.
*   **Escape:** It is *possible* to break out (Lockpicking + Stealth), but the penalty for capture is severe (Sentence Doubled + Outlaw Flag).

---

## 4. The Jail Environment

Jails are not instanced. They are physical locations in the world.
*   **Public View:** Citizens can walk by the "Labor Yard" and jeer at the prisoners.
*   **Shame:** The humiliation of being seen "working the rocks" is part of the punishment.
