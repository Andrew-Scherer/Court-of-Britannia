# ⚔️ Bounty System

**Justice, Criminals, and Bounty Hunters**

---


> *Crime has consequences. Justice has a price. Hunters have a career.*


## Core Principle

The Bounty System creates real consequences for criminal behavior and legitimate careers for those who enforce justice outside the formal guard structure.

**Key Features:**


- Bounties issued by Magistrate, King, Queen, or Regent
- Paid from City Treasury
- Premium for capturing criminals alive (full price)
- Half price for bringing them back dead
- Public bounty board with last known locations
- Private Bounty Log tracking all actions


## Who Can Issue Bounties


> **Note**
> **Bounty Authority**
>
> Bounties can be issued by:
> - **Magistrate** — Through formal court ruling
> - **King** — By royal decree
> - **Queen** — By royal decree
> - **Regent** — By acting authority decree

**Methods of Issuing:**


- **By Ruling** — Formal court decision after trial or hearing
- **By Word** — Direct decree from King, Queen, or Regent


## Bounty Payment Structure


### Alive vs Dead


| Delivery Method | Payment | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Alive(subdued and dragged to jail) | Full bounty price | Allows real justice through court of law |
| Dead(player's head returned) | Half bounty price | Justice denied, but threat eliminated |


> **✅ Note**
> Bringing a criminal back alive allows them to face trial, answer for their crimes publicly, and provides the opportunity for exile, sentencing, or other judicial outcomes. This preserves the integrity of the justice system while still rewarding hunters.


### Payment Source

All bounties are paid from the **City Treasury**.


- No personal bounties (prevents abuse)
- Official state-sanctioned justice only
- Bounty hunters work for the crown, not private vendettas


## The Two Interfaces


### 1. Public Bounty Board


> **Note**
> **What Players See**
>
> The public bounty board displays:
> - **Target Name** — Who is wanted
> - **Crime** — What they're accused of
> - **Current Reward** — Bounty amount (alive/dead split shown)
> - **Issue Date** — When bounty was placed
> - **Last Seen Location** — Where target was last spotted
> - **Issuing Authority** — Who ordered the bounty


### Threaded Message Board

The bounty board functions as a threaded message system where players can:


- Leave tips on criminal locations
- Share sightings and movement patterns
- Coordinate hunting efforts
- Warn others of dangerous targets

**This creates community engagement and makes hunting a collaborative effort.**


### 2. Private Bounty Log


> **Note**
> **Administrative Record**
>
> Similar to the Land Registry, the Bounty Log tracks:
> - **Actor:** Who issued/cancelled/claimed the bounty
> - **Action:** Type (issued, cancelled, claimed, paid)
> - **Target:** Criminal name
> - **Amount:** Bounty value
> - **Timestamp:** When action occurred

**Who Can View Bounty Log:**


- Magistrate
- King
- Queen
- Regent
- Chancellor (treasury oversight)


## Bounty Cancellation


### Manual Cancellation

Bounties can be cancelled manually by the same authorities who can issue them:


- Magistrate
- King
- Queen
- Regent

**Reasons for Cancellation:**


- Criminal captured and sentenced
- Crime pardoned
- New evidence exonerates the accused
- Political reasons (deals, alliances, etc.)


### Automatic Expiration


> **❗ Note**
> Bounties include a 24-hour timer that can cancel the bounty, but it must be manually triggered. This prevents old, irrelevant bounties from cluttering the system while still requiring deliberate action.


## Legitimate Roles Created


### 1. The Criminal


> **Note**
> **Risk and Consequence**
>
> While players can:
> - Rob indiscriminately
> - Steal without mercy
> - Kill without provocation
> **This doesn't mean they will be able to do so for very long without:**
> - Significant punishment
> - Resources set aside to answer for their crimes
> - Constant threat of bounty hunters
> - Limited safe zones

**Being a criminal becomes a legitimate playstyle with real stakes.**


### 2. The Bounty Hunter


> **✅ Note**
> The bounty system gives players who want to hunt criminals a legitimate profession:
> - Steady income from City Treasury
> - Recognition for successful captures
> - Strategic gameplay (tracking, planning, capturing)
> - Choice between lethal and non-lethal methods
> - Community collaboration via bounty board


## How It Works


### Step 1: Bounty Issued


1. Magistrate rules in court OR King/Queen/Regent decrees
2. Bounty amount set based on crime severity
3. Target added to public bounty board
4. Action logged in private Bounty Log
5. Bounty hunters can now pursue target


### Step 2: The Hunt


1. Hunters review bounty board for targets
2. Check last known locations and tips from other players
3. Track target across the world
4. Decide approach: subdue alive or kill


### Step 3: Capture or Kill

**Option A: Capture Alive**


1. Hunter subdues target (combat mechanics)
2. Target is incapacitated but not killed
3. Hunter drags target to jail
4. Delivers target to authorities
5. Receives full bounty payment

**Option B: Kill and Return Head**


1. Hunter kills target
2. Takes target's head as proof
3. Returns head to authorities
4. Receives half bounty payment


### Step 4: Payment and Resolution


1. Hunter receives payment from City Treasury
2. Bounty marked as claimed in Bounty Log
3. Target removed from public bounty board
4. If alive: Criminal faces court/sentencing
5. If dead: Case closed

## Integration with Other Systems


### Jail System

Bounties delivered alive enter the jail system where they await trial or sentencing. See [[Jail System|Jail]] for details.


### Court System

Magistrate can issue bounties as part of court rulings. Captured criminals face trial unless already convicted.


### Chronicle

Major bounty captures become part of the Chronicle, recording who captured whom and under what circumstances.


### Permadeath

If a bounty target dies permanently (permadeath), the bounty is automatically cancelled. Hunter receives half payment if they delivered the killing blow.

8. Case closed, threat eliminated


### Scenario 3: Bounty Cancelled


1. Noble accused of treason, bounty issued

4. Noble exonerated publicly
5. Bounty removed from board
6. Cancellation logged in Bounty Log


## Preventing Abuse


> **❗ Note**
> - **No Personal Bounties** — Only official authorities can issue bounties

> - **Full Action Logging** — Every bounty action tracked in Bounty Log
> - **Manual Cancellation Required** — Prevents accidental or automatic removals
> - **Authority Accountability** — Issuing authorities answer for unjust bounties
