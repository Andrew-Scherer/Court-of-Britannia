## What Execution Is

Execution is the enforcement of a lawful sentence that results in permadeath. It is a formal legal process, not synonymous with combat, murder, or extrajudicial killing.

An execution occurs when:


- A lawful authority (Magistrate, King, or authorized noble) has issued a death sentence
- The sentence has not been stayed, commuted, or cancelled
- The scheduled execution time has arrived

Execution is distinct from assassination, battlefield death, or criminal murder. It operates under judicial or royal authority and follows a predictable process with opportunities for intervention. The condemned enters a legal state that culminates in death unless authority intervenes.

Combat may down an enemy. Execution removes them from the world permanently through lawful process.


## Execution as a Legal State Change

When a Magistrate issues a death sentence, the condemned character enters a pending execution state. This is not merely ceremonial—it is a binding legal condition that will resolve in one of several defined outcomes.


### The Flow of Execution


1. **Sentencing:** A Magistrate issues a formal death sentence following trial or decree.
2. **Scheduling:** An execution window is set (typically 2 hours) and announced publicly. The condemned is notified.
3. **Pending State:** The execution exists as a scheduled legal outcome. The character remains alive but under sentence.
4. **Authorization Check:** At the start of the execution window, the system verifies whether the sentence remains valid.
5. **Resolution:** If valid, execution proceeds based on whether the condemned appears during the window. If invalid, execution is cancelled.

This structure ensures that execution proceeds even if no player acts, but *how* it proceeds depends entirely on presence.


## Scheduling and Public Notice

Executions are never silent or instant. They are announced in advance with a specific execution window—typically a 2-hour period during which the execution may occur. This creates time between sentencing and death during which political forces may act.


### The Execution Window

The Magistrate schedules an **execution window** rather than an exact time. This window provides flexibility for participants while preventing indefinite delays.

**Standard window duration:** 2 hours. This gives the condemned, Executioner, King, and witnesses opportunity to attend without requiring exact synchronization.

**Window mechanics:**


- If the condemned appears during the window, execution proceeds manually with full ceremony
- If the condemned does not appear by the end of the window, execution proceeds automatically
- The King may attend at any point during the window to grant mercy or witness the execution
- The Executioner may perform the execution at any point when the condemned is present


### What Public Notice Creates

**Political Pressure:** Nobles may petition for mercy. Allies may threaten consequences. Public sentiment may turn against the Crown or the condemned.

**Opportunity for Mercy:** The King may stay execution, commute the sentence, or convert punishment to exile or imprisonment. This opportunity exists until the window closes.

**Opportunity for Disruption:** Enemies of the Crown may attempt rescue. Allies of the condemned may stage interventions. Guards must prepare for resistance.

The announcement period is not merely flavor—it is the mechanism that allows execution to function as political theater rather than mechanical deletion.


> **Note**
> **Minimum Notice Period**

> Executions must be scheduled at least 24 hours in advance. This ensures that all parties—including the condemned—have time to respond, negotiate, or intervene. Rushed executions undermine legitimacy and create scandal.


### The Public Execution Site

Executions occur at a designated public location—typically near the bank or another heavily traversed area. This location is known to all citizens and serves as the official site of Crown justice.

The condemned is transported to this location while subdued. Guards maintain order. Witnesses gather. The space becomes a stage for legitimacy or scandal depending on how events unfold.


## Authorization Check

At the start of the execution window, the system performs an authorization check. This determines whether the execution proceeds or is cancelled.


### If the Sentence Has Been Stayed, Commuted, or Cancelled

Execution does not proceed. The condemned is released, exiled, or converted to another punishment depending on the nature of the intervention. The pending execution state is removed.


### If Authorization Remains Valid

The execution window opens. The condemned is notified and has the duration of the window to appear. The King retains authority to intervene throughout the entire window.

This check ensures that Crown authority can intervene up until the window closes. Once the window ends without appearance or intervention, the process becomes inevitable.


## Presence-Based Resolution

This is the core mechanical distinction that preserves immersion while preventing abuse. How an execution resolves depends entirely on whether the condemned appears during the execution window.


### If the Condemned Does Not Appear During the Window

When the execution window closes without the condemned appearing, execution proceeds automatically. The character dies permanently. Absence does not delay or prevent justice.

When the player next logs in, they are informed that their character was executed in absentia. The character is permanently unplayable. All roles vacate. Property enters grace period. The death is logged with timestamp and circumstances.

Refusing to appear provides no protection. Justice proceeds without ceremony when the condemned chooses absence over facing judgment.


### If the Condemned Appears During the Window

When the condemned logs in during the execution window, they are transported to the public execution site while subdued (see Permadeath & Downed States for subduing mechanics).

Once at the execution site:


- The condemned remains subdued and unable to flee
- The Executioner can perform a single-blow execution that causes instant permadeath
- Guards maintain order and prevent disruption
- Witnesses observe the ceremony unfold
- The King may arrive and grant mercy, commute the sentence, or allow execution to proceed

This preserves immersion and player agency. A character whose body is present experiences a visible, ceremonial death rather than silent deletion.


### What Happens if the Executioner is Absent

If the Executioner is not present during the execution window but the condemned appears, any authorized agent of the Crown may perform the execution. This includes:


- The King personally
- Guards acting under royal decree
- A temporarily appointed executioner

If no authorized agent is present and the window closes, execution proceeds automatically. The execution is not dependent on a single role holder—it is a legal process that will resolve with or without ceremony.


## Execution as Ceremony (Optional)

Ceremony is the public performance of execution. It includes speeches, rituals, witness gathering, and formal proceedings. Ceremony is powerful, memorable, and politically significant.

Ceremony is also entirely optional.


### When Ceremony Occurs

If the condemned appears during the execution window, full ceremony becomes possible. The condemned is brought to the public execution site while subdued. The Executioner, guards, witnesses, heralds, and nobles may attend. The condemned may speak final words. The King may arrive personally to witness or grant mercy. The event becomes theater.


### When Ceremony Does Not Occur

If the condemned does not appear during the window, execution proceeds automatically without ceremony. The condemned dies in absentia. The outcome is recorded but not performed publicly.

Attendance affects *how* execution happens, never *whether* it happens.


## The Mercy Window

The period between sentencing and execution is the mercy window. During this time, the Crown retains full authority to alter the outcome.


### Between Sentencing and Execution

The King may:


- Commute the sentence to exile or imprisonment
- Stay execution pending further review
- Convert punishment to fines, penance, or probation
- Pardon the condemned entirely

This is the window for political negotiation. Allies petition. Enemies push for finality. The Crown weighs legitimacy, mercy, and consequences.


### During the Execution Window

Throughout the execution window, the King retains full authority to intervene. If the condemned appears, the King may arrive at the execution site and halt proceedings to grant mercy, commute the sentence, or allow execution to proceed.

Once the window closes, mercy is no longer possible. If the condemned appeared and was not executed during the window, execution proceeds immediately as the window ends.

Presence invites mercy by creating visibility and political pressure. Absence forfeits mercy by removing the condemned from the negotiation space.


> **❗ Note**


## Possible Outcomes

Execution as a legal state can resolve in multiple ways depending on authority decisions made during the mercy window.


| Outcome | Authority Required | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Death (Permadeath) | Original sentence stands | Character dies permanently. All roles vacate. Property enters grace period. Death is logged. |
| Exile | Crown commutes sentence | Character is permanently banished from the kingdom. Return results in immediate re-execution. |
| Imprisonment | Crown commutes sentence | Character is held in custody for a defined period. Rare. Used when death is too severe but release is unacceptable. |
| Pardon | Crown grants full pardon | Sentence is voided. Character is released with no penalties. Creates political consequences for the Crown. |
| Delay | Crown stays execution | Execution is postponed pending review. Creates ongoing political tension and uncertainty. |


> **Note**
> **Crown Authority Over Sentencing**
>
> **Only the Crown may commute a death sentence.** Magistrates sentence. The King decides if mercy is warranted. This separation ensures that judicial authority and royal prerogative remain distinct.


## Failure States and Consequences

Execution mechanics are designed so that no failure state blocks the process. Instead, failures create political consequences and story fuel.


### Executioner Absent

**What happens:** Another authorized agent performs the execution, or the condemned dies automatically if logged out.

**Consequence:** Legitimacy tension. The Crown appears unable to manage formal proceedings. Enemies mock the absence. The Executioner role may face scrutiny or replacement.


### Condemned Absent (Did Not Appear)

**What happens:** Execution proceeds automatically when the window closes. Character dies in absentia.

**Consequence:** Impersonal justice. No ceremony. No final words. The condemned is remembered as someone who refused to face judgment.


### Guard Interference or Rescue Attempt

**What happens:** Guards enforce order. If disruption succeeds, guards arrest the disruptors and execution is rescheduled.

**Consequence:** Scandal. The Crown's authority is challenged publicly. Rescuers face charges of treason or sedition. Future executions become heavily guarded.


### Last-Minute Crown Intervention

**What happens:** The King arrives and halts execution, commutes sentence, or grants pardon.

**Consequence:** Political gamble. The Crown is seen as merciful or weak depending on context. Allies are relieved. Enemies exploit perceived indecision.

In all cases, the execution state resolves. The system does not deadlock. Absence or failure redirects the outcome, but never prevents resolution.


## How Execution Mechanics Interlock with Roles

Execution is not controlled by any single role. It is a collaborative process with separation of powers.


### Magistrate

Issues the death sentence following trial or decree. The Magistrate determines guilt and punishment but cannot control mercy or timing after sentencing.


### King

Holds exclusive authority to commute, stay, or pardon. The King may intervene at any point before execution resolves, but carries political consequences for mercy or delay.


### Executioner

Performs the physical act when the condemned is present. The Executioner has no authority to decide guilt, innocence, or mercy—only to carry out lawful sentences.


### Guards

Enforce order during execution. Prevent disruption. Transport the condemned to execution site. May perform execution if the Executioner is absent and authority permits.


### Mechanics Layer

Ensures that execution resolves regardless of player presence. Tracks authorization state. Enforces presence-based resolution. Prevents deadlock.

No single role controls the entire arc. This separation prevents abuse and ensures that execution functions as a political process involving multiple authorities.


## Summary


- **Execution is a legal state change, not a roleplay-only action.** Once sentenced, the condemned enters a pending state that will resolve at the scheduled time.
- **Absence provides no immunity.** Execution proceeds automatically if the condemned does not appear during the window. Absence removes opportunity for mercy and ceremony.
- **Presence preserves immersion.** Characters who appear during the window are brought to the public execution site while subdued and experience visible, ceremonial execution.
- **Execution windows prevent scheduling deadlock.** A 2-hour window accommodates participant availability without allowing indefinite delay.
- **The condemned is subdued during execution.** They are transported to the execution site and cannot flee. The Executioner can perform a single-blow execution.
- **Public notice creates political space.** The window between sentencing and execution allows for petitions, negotiations, disruptions, and Crown intervention.
- **The King may intervene throughout the window.** Crown authority can grant mercy at any point until the window closes.
- **Only the Crown may commute a death sentence.** Magistrates sentence. The King decides mercy. The Executioner performs. No single role controls the entire process.
- **Ceremony depends on attendance, not legality.** Full ritual occurs when participants are present. Execution proceeds without ceremony when they are absent.
- **Failure states create stories, not deadlock.** Absent executioners, rescue attempts, and Crown interventions generate political consequences rather than blocking resolution.
- **Executions occur at a public site.** A designated location near the bank serves as the official execution ground where witnesses gather and ceremony unfolds.
- **Multiple outcomes exist beyond death.** Exile, imprisonment, pardon, and delay are all possible if the Crown intervenes during the mercy window.
- **Justice proceeds with or without theater.** Execution is guaranteed by mechanics. Ceremony is enabled by roleplay. Both are valid expressions of lawful authority.
