# 🔒 Jail & Work Camp System

**Teaching Criminals How to Make an Honest Living**

---

> *If you suck at crime, we'll give you the tools to learn how to craft instead.*

## Core Philosophy: Rehabilitation Through Labor

Jail is the backstop for criminals who cannot pay their debts. The Work Camp is a training mechanism that teaches bad criminals how to earn gold legitimately through crafting and trade.

*   **The Goal**: Resolution of Grey Status + Teaching legitimate gameplay.
*   **The Method**: **Asset Recovery** or **Work Camp Labor**.
*   **The Result**: The player returns to society with skills to make an honest living.

## 1. The Jail Sentence (Teleportation to Work Camp)

When a Grey Criminal is caught, the system attempts **Asset Recovery** (paying the fine from their bank).
*   **If Bank >= Fine**: The fine is paid. **No Jail**.
*   **If Bank < Fine**: The player is **teleported to Work Camp**.

### The Work Camp Mechanic
*   **Conversion Rate**: 1 Minute per X Gold of unpaid fine.
*   **Location**: **Instanced** work camp (isolated from the main world).
*   **Two Options for Prisoners**:
    1. **Work Off the Fine**: Complete hard labor to reduce sentence.
    2. **Suicide (The Noose)**: Use the noose to commit suicide, permanently killing their character so they can start over.

## 2. Work Camp: A Training Ground

The Work Camp provides access to a **filtered version of Britain's trade board**, teaching prisoners how to make gold through legitimate means.

### Available Trade Orders
Prisoners can fill trade orders for:
*   **Stone**
*   **Ore**
*   **Craftable Materials** (TBD)
*   **Other Hard Labor Materials** (TBD)

### Crafting Stations (Instanced)
The Work Camp includes basic crafting stations:
*   **Blacksmith and Anvil**
*   **Loom**
*   **Thread Wheel**
*   **Sheep** (for collecting wool)

### Educational Purpose
*   **Teaches Trade Board**: Players learn how to fulfill buy orders.
*   **Teaches Crafting**: Players learn how blacksmithing, weaving, and resource gathering work.
*   **Aligns with New Player Experience**: New players will likely commit crimes, so this provides a soft punishment that teaches them safe gold-earning methods.

## 3. Why Work Camp Works

### Crime Should Be a Conscious Choice
*   **Not for Fun**: Crime should not be something players do casually or for entertainment.
*   **Not Out of Necessity**: Players should have legitimate options to earn gold (crafting, trade).
*   **Economic Reality**: If you are rich, you lose gold. If you are poor, you learn how to craft and trade.

### New Player Rehabilitation
Many new players commit crimes because they don't know how to earn gold safely. The Work Camp:
*   **Reveals Hidden Systems**: Many players don't know crafting stations and trade boards exist.
*   **Provides Skills**: Players leave with knowledge of how to make gold without harming others.
*   **Reduces Recidivism**: Criminals who learn to craft are less likely to return to crime.

## 4. The Noose: A Second Chance

For players who want to completely start over, the Work Camp includes **a noose**.

*   **Suicide Option**: Players can choose to hang themselves rather than work off their sentence.
*   **Permanent Character Death**: The character is permanently killed.
*   **Fresh Start**: Players can create a new character and try again.
