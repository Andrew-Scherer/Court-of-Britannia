# 💰 Bounty System
**Victim-Funded Retribution**

---

## 📜 The Philosophy
The Crown does not subsidize justice. If you are murdered, **your gold** pays for the vengeance. 

Bounties are not printed from thin air; they are extracted from the victim's bank at the moment of death and placed on the killer's head.

## ⚰️ Bounty Generation (The Source)

When a murder is recorded in the [Mortuary Rolls], a "Potential Bounty" is calculated based on the **Victim's Legitimacy Tier**. This gold is technically "lost" by the victim upon death, but inherently tied to the crime.

### Legitimacy Tiers & Conversion Rates

| Victim Status | % of Victim's Bank Converted to Bounty |
| :--- | :--- |
| **King / Monarch** | **50%** |
| **Noble / Peer** | **40%** |
| **Citizen (Standard)** | **25%** |

> **Example**:
> *   A Merchant (Citizen) with **1,000g** in the bank is murdered.
> *   **250g** (25%) is assessed as the "Potential Bounty Pool" for this crime.

## 🔍 Activation (The Forensic Key)

A bounty does **not** exist simply because a murder occurred. It must be **proven**.

1.  **The Murder**: The victim dies. Body decomposes.
2.  **The Window**: A [Forensic Investigator] has 24 hours to find the corpse.
3.  **The Split**:
    *   **If Unsolved**: The body rots. The "Potential Bounty" vanishes. **0g** is placed on the killer.
    *   **If Solved**: The Investigator files a report. The Bounty is **Activated**.

### The "Solve" Mechanic
A crime is mechanically **Solved** when a Forensic Investigator successfully uses the forensic skill to attribute the death to a specific character in the [Mortuary Rolls].

*   **First Solver Wins**: Only the **first** investigator to actively solve the crime (retrieve the signature) is eligible for the 30% cut. Subsequent investigators get nothing.
*   **Visual Confirmation**: Upon a successful solve, the corpse's tooltip updates globally to: *"The corpse of [Victim], murdered by [Killer]"*.

### The 70/30 Locked Split
Once activated, the bounty is irrevocably divided:

*   **70% (The Hunter's Pot)**: 175g (from example) goes to the **Executor**.
*   **30% (The Investigator's Lock)**: 75g (from example) is **Locked** for the **Investigator**.

> **Note**: The Investigator does *not* get paid immediately. They get paid **when the killer is brought to justice**. Their payout is attached to the criminal's fate.

## ⚔️ Distribution (The Payout)

When a Bounty Hunter kills a Red player and turns in the Head:

1.  **The Hunter**: Receives **100% of the Available Hunter Pot** (The 70% portions of all murders committed by that Red).
2.  **The Investigators**: The Treasury automatically releases the **Locked 30% portions** to the bank accounts of every Investigator who contributed a solve to that criminal's record.

---

## ⚖️ Summary
*   **No Taxes**: The Crown pays nothing.
*   **No Inflation**: Gold is transferred, not created.
*   **No Solves, No Bounties**: Uninvestigated crimes are free crimes.
