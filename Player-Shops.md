# 🏪 Player-Owned Shops

**Visible Economic Actors in Britain**

---


## Overview

Allowing players to buy and control shops (apothecaries, armories, tailors) inside Britain turns crafters into **visible economic actors**, not background NPCs.

This is a fundamental shift:


- Shops are **physical locations** in the city
- Shop ownership is **public and recorded**
- Items sold carry **shop provenance**
- Shops can be **bought, sold, seized, or closed**


## Shop Provenance

**Items sold through player-owned shops carry:**


- Shop name
- City location
- Optional crafter signature (if exceptional or commissioned)


### Example


> **Note**
> *Exceptional Leather Jerkin*  
> 
>             Crafted by **Maribel**  
> 
>             Sold by **The Green Flask, Britain**

That item now carries:


- **Reputation** — You know who made it
- **Geography** — You know where it came from
- **Political implication** — Patterns become visible


## Why Shop Marks Matter

If all the guards wear armor from the same shop, people notice.

That shop becomes:


- **Politically relevant** — Royal patronage is visible
- **Economically powerful** — Supplier to the Crown
- **Potentially vulnerable** — Target during coups
- **Socially connected** — Networks are traceable


> **✅ Note**


## Types of Player Shops


| Shop Type | Primary Goods | Political Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| Armory | Weapons, armor, shields | High — supplies military forces |
| Apothecary | Potions, reagents, poisons | Medium — healing and assassination |
| Tailor | Clothing, robes, status wear | Medium — visible social markers |
| Provisioner | Food, supplies, tools | Low — essential but less visible |


## Shop Ownership Mechanics


### Acquiring a Shop

Shops can be obtained through:


- **Purchase** — Buy an available shop location
- **Inheritance** — Receive through [[succession|Succession]]
- **Royal Grant** — Awarded by the [[King|Becoming-King]]
- **Seizure** — Taken through legal or military action


### Operating a Shop

Shop owners can:


- Stock items (crafted or purchased)
- Set prices
- Control access
- Refuse customers
- Hire staff (future feature)


### Losing a Shop

Shops can be lost through:


- **Death** — Passes to [[heirs|Heir]] or reverts to available
- **Seizure** — Royal or court order
- **Sale** — Owner sells voluntarily
- **Abandonment** — Extended inactivity


## Political Implications


### Shop Networks Create Visibility

When multiple shops share:


- Common owners
- Common suppliers
- Common customer bases

...patterns emerge that reveal:


- Economic alliances
- Political factions
- Supply chains
- Potential monopolies


### Shops as Leverage Points

Control over shops means control over:


- **Military supply** — Who arms the guards?
- **Status symbols** — Who provides noble attire?
- **Essential goods** — Who controls reagents, tools, food?

A schemer who controls Britain's armory doesn't need to pick up a sword.


## How This Feeds Other Systems


| System | How Player Shops Enhance It |
|---|---|
| Crafters | Reputation and economic visibility |
| Schemers | Supply-chain manipulation |
| Guards | Visible patronage relationships |
| Succession | Shops as inheritableproperty |
| King | Shops as rewards or punishment targets |


## Shop Records

Like all systems in this shard, shops generate **persistent public records**:


- Current owner
- Ownership history
- Shop type and location
- Optional: Transaction logs (high-value items)

This creates accountability and enables investigation.


> If everyone who wore armor from "The Iron Oak" was arrested during the coup, that shop's owner has questions to answer.


## Why This Works

Player shops succeed because they:


- **Create visibility** — Crafters become known
- **Generate consequence** — Supply choices matter
- **Enable reputation** — Quality and service build brands
- **Produce political exposure** — Patronage is traceable
- **Feed other systems** — Everything connects

This isn't just NPC vendors with player names.

This is economic activity as **political statement**.
