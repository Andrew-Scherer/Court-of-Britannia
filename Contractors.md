# Contractors

## Purpose

The Contractor system allows settlements to employ, collaborate with, and depend on **non-guild members** for labor and services without forcing political membership or risking asset seizure.

Contractors enable specialization, economic interdependence, and settlement growth while preserving player autonomy and trust.

Contractors are **participants**, not citizens.

---

## Core Principle

> **Settlements may grant limited, revocable access to non-members  
> to perform specific services without transferring ownership or authority.**

Contractors work *with* settlements, not *inside* them politically.

---

## Definition

A **Contractor** is a player granted scoped access to perform a specific function on guild-controlled property without becoming a member of the guild.

Contractors may include:

* Builders
* Decorators
* Crafters
* Vendor Operators
* Other future specialist roles

Each contractor role is:

* explicitly granted
* narrowly scoped
* fully revocable
* non-political

---

## What Contractors Are Not

Contractors are **not**:

* guild members
* property owners
* political actors
* protected from taxation
* guaranteed permanence

They do not gain:

* voting rights
* guild leadership access
* property control
* faction authority
* immunity from settlement rules

---

## Contractor Categories

### Builder Contractors

Builder Contractors are permitted to **construct structural elements** on guild-controlled land.

They may:

* place floors, walls, roofs, doors, stairs, and structural dividers
* lock construction elements to the property
* shape space within settlement boundaries

They may not:

* alter access permissions
* place guildstones
* unbind property
* access storage or vendors unless separately granted

All construction is destroyed automatically if:

* the property changes hands
* the guild relocates or collapses
* access is revoked

---

### Decorator Contractors

Decorator Contractors are permitted to **place cosmetic elements** on guild-controlled property.

They may:

* place decorations, banners, rugs, lights, visual props
* arrange interiors and public spaces
* express settlement identity
* apply thematic overlays to pre-existing structures (walls, roofs, floors, etc.)

They may not:

* place structural elements
* alter the access rules of doors
* interact with vendors
* affect upkeep or construction limits

Decorations persist only while the property remains under guild control.

---

### Crafter Contractors

Crafter Contractors produce goods **for or within** a settlement.

They may:

* craft items using personal skills and resources
* sell goods via assigned vendors
* participate in internal or public markets
* operate without guild membership

They may not:

* access guild resources unless explicitly granted
* bypass taxes
* control vendor placement (vendors are placed, they are given claim to them)
* access other contractors' assets or vendors

Vendor operation for crafters is governed by the **Vendor Contractors** system.

---

## Granting Contractor Access

Contractor access is granted by the guild through designated roles:

* Builders and Decorators are assigned via **property permissions**
* Vendor access is assigned via the guild's **Trade Minister** role
* All contractor access is:
  * explicit
  * logged
  * revocable

Granting access does **not**:

* require guild membership
* consume a property slot
* create permanent claims

---

## Revocation of Contractor Access

Contractor access may be revoked at any time.

### On Revocation

* contractor permissions end immediately
* no contractor inventory or property is seized
* no work is retroactively undone
* contractors retain all personal assets

For vendor contractors specifically:

* inventory and gold are transferred to the contractor's private bank

Revocation is an administrative action, not a punishment.

---

## Contractor Death (Permadeath)

If a contractor dies:

* all contractor access ends
* all personal assets are preserved via account systems
* no settlement inherits contractor property
* infrastructure remains intact

Contractors lose position, not ownership.

---

## Property Loss or Settlement Collapse

If a settlement:

* loses the property
* collapses
* relocates

Then:

* all contractor access ends
* all contractor-placed objects are destroyed
* all personal assets are preserved

No contractor loses items due to political outcomes.

---

## Why Contractors Exist

The Contractor system exists to:

* prevent forced guild membership
* enable specialization
* support large settlements
* reduce internal theft and drama
* allow markets to form organically
* keep politics and economics separable

It creates **real interdependence** instead of alt abuse.

---

## Design Guarantees

This system guarantees that:

* contractors cannot be robbed by administrators
* settlements cannot seize contractor labor
* access can always be revoked cleanly
* participation does not require allegiance
* abuse produces reputation loss, not loot

Trust is enforced mechanically.

---

## Summary

> **Contractors build, decorate, and trade.  
> Guilds govern and tax.  
> Ownership never transfers implicitly.**

Settlements grow through cooperation, not coercion.
