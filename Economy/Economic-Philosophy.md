# 📜 Economic Philosophy & Overview

**The Foundations of Political Economy**

---


## Core Principle

The economic systems of Britannia—taxation, upkeep, liens, and seizure—exist to create **pressure**, not punishment. They do not block play. They do not require constant manual intervention. They do not restrict access to goods or services.

Instead, these systems convert economic activity into political consequence. Revenue flows automatically. Economic behavior shifts naturally. Political accountability follows visibility.


## Design Philosophy


### Pressure Over Punishment

Economic systems are tools of **political pressure**. They create conditions that force choices, reveal priorities, and test legitimacy. They do not dictate outcomes—they create environments where outcomes emerge from player decisions.


- **Taxation** reflects recognition of authority, not automatic extraction
- **Upkeep** scales costs with ambition, preventing land hoarding
- **Liens** intercept growth while preserving survival
- **Seizure** demonstrates power or exposes weakness


### Visibility Over Micromanagement

The system does not prevent poor decisions. It ensures poor decisions are **visible**. Public ledgers, automatic logging, and transparent records replace hidden calculations and admin oversight.


> **Note**
> **Design Principle:** "Visibility replaces micromanagement."
> The system does not protect leadership from failure. It documents failure so that political consequences can follow.


### Political, Not Mechanical

Economic enforcement is never automatic. It requires:


- Human decisions (decrees must be issued)
- Guard participation (force must be demonstrated, not assumed)
- Public declaration (seizure must be visible and contestable)
- Political cost (every action creates consequences)


> **❗ Note**
> **Foundational Rule:** Seizure is a political act executed under color of law, not a mechanical penalty for unpaid taxes.


## The Four Economic Tools

Britannia's economy operates through four distinct but interconnected systems. Each serves a different purpose and creates different kinds of pressure.


| System | Purpose | Nature | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Taxation | Generate revenue, assert authority | Automatic collection | Economic pressure via cost of living and trade |
| Upkeep | Prevent land hoarding, scale costs with size | Neutral, mechanical | Territory requires active economic engagement |
| Liens | Apply economic pressure without deletion | Political tool | Intercepts growth, strangles expansion |
| Seizure | Convert authority into resources | Political force | Tests legitimacy, reveals power |


## Economic Actors


### The Crown

The Crown (King or Regent) possesses the authority to:


- Levy taxes on those who recognize its authority (citizens, Crown-aligned guilds)
- Issue decrees authorizing seizure
- Apply Crown liens to guild or faction treasuries
- Declare entities insolvent

**Limits:** The Crown may tax only those who accept its jurisdiction. Taxation presumes a compact. Neutral or rebel factions are not taxable—but they may still be seized from, as an act of force rather than fiscal policy.


### Guilds & Factions

Guilds and factions possess economic powers of their own:


- Set sales tax rates on player vendors operating from their property
- May impose internal fees or tribute on members (policy decision)
- Control access to commerce and crafting infrastructure
- Compete economically for crafter talent and trade dominance

**Distinction:** Guilds operate within the civic compact and may be evicted. Factions are sovereign entities that cannot be evicted but may be pressured, isolated, or confronted.


### Guards

Guards are not automatons. They are **permitted, not required**, to enforce economic decrees:


- May refuse to execute seizures
- Captains may stall or countermand
- The Marshal may intervene
- The Magistrate may challenge legal basis

If guards decline to enforce, seizure fails materially—but this is not a system failure. It is legitimacy being tested.


### Players

Individual players interact with economic systems through:


- Trade (subject to player trade taxes)
- NPC purchases (subject to system fees)
- Vendor ownership (subject to guild/faction taxes)
- Guild/faction membership (collective economic survival)


## Key Distinctions


### Tax vs Upkeep


> **Note**
> **Tax:** Political. Requires recognition of authority. Can be refused. Refusal has consequences.
> **Upkeep:** Neutral. Mechanical cost tied to property size. Not political. Failure = collapse, not eviction.

Unpaid taxes create political pretext for action. Failed upkeep creates automatic decay. The Crown cannot "evict via tax." It can only seize, sanction, or wage war.


### Lien vs Seizure


> **Note**
> **Lien:** Intercepts future income. Applies continuous pressure. Cannot block upkeep. Does not delete entities.
> **Seizure:** One-time confiscation attempt. Requires decree, notice, window, and guard enforcement. May fail if treasury is empty or guards refuse.


### Taxation vs Tribute


> **Note**
> **Crown Taxation:** Levied on recognized subjects. Automatic collection. Flows into city treasury.
> **Guild/Faction Taxation:** Levied on vendor sales within guild/faction property. Set by leaders. Flows into guild/faction coffers.


## Failure Is Visible, Not Prevented

The economic systems do not protect leadership from poor decisions. They do not cap rates at "reasonable" levels. They do not issue automatic warnings beyond what officials choose to provide.

**How Economic Failure Manifests:**


1. Tax rates rise beyond sustainable thresholds
2. Trade activity declines as merchants relocate or cease operations
3. Daily revenue decreases despite higher rates
4. Treasury shortfalls appear in public ledgers
5. Wage payments are reduced or suspended
6. Political fallout intensifies—protests, rival claimants, civil unrest

The system records these failures. It does not prevent them.


> **Note**
> **Canon Statement:** "Revenue is automatic. Accountability is human."


## Economic Consequences Emerge from Behavior

Tax policy, upkeep costs, and economic pressure produce effects. These effects emerge from **player behavior**, not system enforcement. The economic systems do not dictate outcomes—they create conditions.

**Observable Patterns:**


- High Crown taxes → merchants relocate to lower-tax cities or black markets
- High guild/faction vendor taxes → crafters defect to rival organizations
- Failed upkeep → property decay, faction collapse, vacant territory
- Crown liens → factions survive but cannot expand, pressure mounts internally
- Failed seizures → Crown appears weak, rivals gain confidence

These are not instructions. They are patterns that emerge when economic pressure meets political structure. Players choose how to respond. The system records the result.


> **Note**
> **Canon Statement:** "Taxes do not stop activity. They change where it happens."


## Summary

Britannia's economic systems are designed to:


- Create political pressure, not mechanical punishment
- Ensure visibility through automatic logging and public records
- Force human decisions rather than automate outcomes
- Test legitimacy by requiring guard participation in enforcement
- Preserve player agency while creating meaningful consequences

Taxation reflects political authority. Upkeep scales with ambition. Liens apply pressure. Seizure demonstrates power. None of these systems guarantee outcomes—they create the conditions where outcomes emerge from player choices.
