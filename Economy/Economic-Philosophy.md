# 🏛️ Economic Philosophy & Overview

**The Invisible Hand is a Fist**

---

## Core Philosophy
The economic systems of Britannia exist to create **pressure**, not punishment. They do not block play or require constant manual intervention. Instead, they convert economic activity into political consequence.

### 1. Visibility Over Micromanagement
The system does not prevent poor decisions; it ensures they are **visible**. Public ledgers, automatic logging, and transparent records replace hidden calculations.
- If a King taxes too much, the **Tax Ledger** proves it.
- If a Guild fails to pay, the **Upkeep Ledger** shows it.

### 2. Political, Not Mechanical
Economic enforcement is never automatic. It requires:
- **Human decisions** (Decrees)
- **Guard participation** (Force)
- **Public declaration** (Transparency)

The server code handles the **math** (calculating debt), but players handle the **consequence** (seizure).

## The Four Pillars of Economic Pressure

The economy uses four distinct tools to apply pressure to different types of entities.

| Tool | Target | Purpose | Nature | Effect |
|------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| **[Taxation](Crown-Taxation.md)** | Citizens & Trade | Revenue | Automatic | Cost of Living / Inflation |
| **[Upkeep](../Guilds/Guild-Upkeep.md)** | Land & Property | Anti-Hoarding | Mechanical | Decay & Collapse |
| **[Liens](Crown-Liens.md)** | Debtors | Interception | Political | Stagnation (Growth Cap) |
| **[Seizure](Seizure-Enforcement.md)** | Rebels / Delinquents | Confiscation | Force | Assets Lost / Political Crisis |

### Tax vs. Upkeep
It is critical to distinguish between these two costs:
- **Tax** is a political payment to the Crown. It can be refused (rebellion) or evaded.
- **Upkeep** is a mechanical cost of maintaining land (entropy). It cannot be "refused"—failure simply means the building falls down.

## The Two-Layer Market
The economy consists of two complementary layers that balance convenience with local flavor.

| Layer | Purpose | Scope | Document |
|-------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Britain Unified Market** | Bulk trade & liquidity | Global Hub | **[Trade & Clearinghouse](Trade-Clearinghouse.md)** |
| **Player Vendors** | Local, social trade | Guild Territories | **[Player Vendors](../Guilds/Player-Vendors.md)** |
