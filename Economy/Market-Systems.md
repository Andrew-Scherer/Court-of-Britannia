# 💰 Market & Economic Systems
**The Unified Spine of Britain's Trade**

---

## 🏛️ Economic Philosophy
The economic systems of Britannia exist to create **pressure**, not punishment. They do not block play or require constant manual intervention. Instead, they convert economic activity into political consequence.

### Visibility Over Micromanagement
The system does not prevent poor decisions; it ensures they are **visible**. Public ledgers, automatic logging, and transparent records replace hidden calculations.

### Political, Not Mechanical
Economic enforcement is never automatic. It requires:
- **Human decisions** (Decrees)
- **Guard participation** (Force)
- **Public declaration** (Transparency)

## 🏪 The Two-Layer Market
The economy consists of two complementary layers that balance convenience with local flavor.

| Layer | Purpose | Scope | Access |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Britain Unified Market** | Bulk trade & liquidity | Global (Back-end) | Licensed Brokers Only |
| **Player NPC Vendors** | Local, social trade | Per Vendor | Physical Presence |

### 1. Britain: The Economic Hub
Britain aggregates trade intent and provides the market spine. It is the **only place** where players can create **persistent orders** that survive logout and death.

- **Buy Orders**: Buyers escrow gold in the Britain Bank.
- **Sell Orders**: Sellers deposit items into market escrow.
- **FIFO Matching**: Oldest/Highest price orders fill first.
- **Crown Tariff**: 2% upfront fee (gold sink) to prevent spam.

### 2. Player NPC Vendors (The Soul of UO)
Player vendors are individually owned, location-bound, and manually stocked. They preserve the social flavor of trade and enable specialized shops.
- **Restriction**: In Season 1, vendors may **only** be placed on **Guild/Faction Property**. independent housing does not support public vending.

## ⚓ The Britain Clearinghouse
The Clearinghouse coordinates demand and provides the market spine for bulk commodities.

### Order Mechanics
1. **Creation**: Merchant specifies item, qty, price, and escrows gold + 2% tariff.
2. **Persistence**: Orders remain active for 1-30 days regardless of player login state.
3. **Fulfillment**: Suppliers deposit goods at Britain Docks and receive immediate payout.
4. **Retrieval**: Buyers withdraw fulfilled goods from the Docks interface.

### Permadeath & Trade
Market positions do not outlive characters. When a character permadeaths:
- **Unfulfilled Escrow**: Burned (Gold Sink).
- **Fulfilled Items (Unclaimed)**: Destroyed (Item Sink).
- **Active Orders**: Instantly cancelled.

## 📜 Economic Enforcement Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Nature | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Taxation** | Revenue generation | Automatic | Economic pressure via cost of living |
| **Upkeep** | Prevent land hoarding | Mechanical | Scales costs with ambition |
| **Liens** | Intercept revenue | Political | Strangles expansion without deletion |
| **Seizure** | Resource confiscation | Physical Force | Tests legitimacy and power |

### Tax vs. Upkeep
- **Tax**: Political acknowledgement. Can be refused (with consequences).
- **Upkeep**: Neutral mechanical cost. Failure equals **automatic decay**, not eviction.
