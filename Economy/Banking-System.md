## 1. Core Banking Mechanics
For the mechanical rules of Storage, Gold, and Items, please see the **[Storage Rules](../Storage-Mechanics/Storage-Rules.md)**.

*   **Gold** is a Global Crown Ledger.
*   **Items** are Local and Physical.
*   **Interfaces:** Britain Bank, City Banks, Guild Vaults, and Private Housing.

---

## 2. Britain Bank (Financial Clearinghouse)
The Britain Bank serves as the purely financial hub of the realm.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Vassals Only**
> Access to the City Banking Network is a privilege of **Crown Allegiance**. 
> *   **Crown Vassals:** Full access to Bank Boxes and gold storage in any city.
> *   **Non-Aligned:** Access **Denied**. Bankers will not serve you. You must rely on physical **Guild Vaults** or **Private Housing** secure storage.

*   **Market Escrow:** All gold for Buy Orders is held here.
*   **Tax Collection:** Civic fines and taxes are routed through this central ledger.
*   **Gold Only:** The physical bank in Britain *does not* handle items (except for special event turn-ins). It is strictly a counting house.

## 3. Trade Docks (Logistical Hub)
Since the Bank handles only gold, the **Trade Docks** handle the physical exchange of commodities.

*   **Imports:** Market purchases arrive here in **Dockside Bins**.
    *   **Free Storage:** 72 hours.
    *   **Demurrage (Tax):** 2.5% of value/day after 72 hours.
*   **Exports:** Sales must be packed in Export Crates and registered here.
    *   **Bond:** 5% listing fee (50% refundable on success).

## 4. Financial Policies
*   **Loans:** The Crown does not issue loans. Players must seek private lending from Guilds.
*   **Interest:** There is no passive interest. Wealth must be active (invested in Trade) to grow.
*   **Seizure:** The Crown reserves the right to freeze or seize assets in the Global Ledger for:
    *   Unpaid Taxes
    *   High Treason
    *   Bounty Settlements

---

## 5. Continuity
*   **Death:** Permadeath triggers an immediate audit of the Global Ledger. Private gold is taxed/seized.
*   **Guild Collapse:** Guild Treasuries are seized by the Crown if the guild dissolves.
