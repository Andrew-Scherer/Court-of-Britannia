# 🏗️ No Player-Placed Housing

**You Occupy History, Not Build It**

---


## The Core Conclusion


> Players do not build new structures.They occupy existing ones.


> **❗ Note**

There are:


- No housing deeds
- No free-placement construction
- No plot claiming
- No blueprint-based building


## Where Players Live

Players live in:


- **Existing buildings** — Already on the map
- **City residences** — Homes, shops, inns within Britain
- **Historic properties** — Forts, keeps, monasteries, coves
- **Embedded structures** — Halls, camps, outposts


> **Note**
> **Every Place Worth Holding Already Exists**
>
> You do not build a fort.  
> 
>             You win one at auction.
> You do not construct a keep.  
> 
>             You bid for one.
> You do not place a house.  
> 
>             You acquire one.


## Why This Matters

This makes:


- Geography finite and contested
- Space meaningful and visible
- Ownership a statement
- History persistent
- Power tied to real places


### Geography Is Finite

In traditional UO:


- Custom housing spreads endlessly
- Maps become cluttered
- Meaningful locations get obscured
- Geography loses structure

Here:


- Every property is hand-placed
- The map is intentional
- Location matters
- Scarcity is real


### Space Is Meaningful

Because housing cannot appear anywhere:


- Zones have identity
- Neighborhoods exist
- Borders matter
- Travel routes are contested


> Power comes from occupying meaningful locations,not from creating new ones.


### Ownership Is Visible

Player-placed housing creates visual chaos.

Fixed housing creates:


- Recognizable landmarks
- Understandable political geography
- Clear territorial claims
- World coherence

When someone says "the Orc Fort," everyone knows where that is.  

        When someone says "guild hall 47," no one does.


### History Persists

Custom housing creates:


- Disposable spaces
- Meaningless churn
- No memory

Fixed housing creates:


- Permanent sites of power
- Contested legacies
- World memory


> **Note**
> **The World Remembers**
>
> The Pirate Cove outlives every guild that claims it.  
> 
>             The Orc Fort exists before and after your occupation.  
> 
>             The Undead Keep waits for the next claimant.
> **Places are permanent. Guilds are temporary.**


## What About Expression?

Players can still express themselves:


- **Decoration** — Free access to decorative items
- **Furniture** — Arrange interiors however you want
- **Vendors** — Place merchants and shops
- **Ambiance** — Lighting, props, atmosphere

What's removed is not **expression**.  

        It's **construction**.


> You don't need to build a castleto make a castle feel like yours.


## Britanniais Not Empty Land


> **❗ Note**

It is a **world with history**.

Players move into that history.  

        They do not redraw it.

This is intentional.  

        This is fundamental.


## How Property Acquisition Works

Properties become available through:


- **Public Auction** — When properties become vacant
- **Crown Sale** — City properties periodically auctioned
- **Guild Collapse** — Historic properties returned to auction

See:


- [[Historic Property|Historic-Property]] — How major sites are claimed
- [[Property & Auctions|Property]] — City property system


## The Design Philosophy

This choice reflects a core principle:


> **Note**
> **The World Is Not A Blank Canvas**
>
> Britannia existed before players arrived.
> It will exist after they leave.
> Players are temporary occupants of permanent places.
> **That is the story this shard tells.**
