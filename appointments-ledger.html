            <h3>Official Record of the Royal Archives of Britain</h3>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: var(--text-muted);">Maintained by the Office of the Royal Clerk<br>In Service to the Crown and the Realm</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Nature and Purpose of the Ledger</h2>
            
            <p>The Noble Appointments Ledger is a bound record housed within the Royal Archives of Britain. Its pages chronicle the appointment, elevation, dismissal, and restoration of those who hold office, title, or authority within the realm.</p>
            
            <p>The Ledger does not confer legitimacy. It does not grant or revoke power. It records only what has occurred: who held authority, by whose command they were appointed, and under what circumstances their tenure began or ended.</p>
            
            <p>In times of certain rule, the Ledger serves as a simple administrative record. In times of contested succession, regency, or civil disorder, it serves a different purpose—it becomes the memory of the realm when memory itself is disputed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What Is Recorded</h2>
            
            <p>Each entry within the Ledger contains the following particulars:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the individual appointed or dismissed</li>
                <li>The office, title, or authority conferred or revoked</li>
                <li>The date and hour of the action</li>
                <li>The identity of the appointing authority</li>
                <li>The nature of that authority at the time of appointment</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This final detail is of particular consequence. The Ledger distinguishes between actions taken by:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>A crowned and consecrated King</li>
                <li>A Regent acting in trust during interregnum</li>
                <li>An authority exercised under emergency decree</li>
                <li>An authority claimed without formal sanction</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The clerk records what is claimed, not what is true. If a man declares himself King and appoints officers in that name, the Ledger notes the claim. It does not affirm it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Offices Subject to Record</h2>
            
            <p>The following appointments are entered into the Ledger upon their enactment:</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why the Ledger Exists</h2>
            
            <p>Britain has known periods of prosperity and peace. It has also known contested successions, rival claimants, and rulers who held power without consent. During such times, truth becomes contested ground.</p>
            
            <p>A dismissed Marshal may claim he was never lawfully removed. A Regent may assert authority over appointments made by a King they refuse to recognize. An Heir may dispute the legitimacy of those elevated during a regency. A usurper may strike names from records and rewrite history to suit the present.</p>
            
            <p>The Ledger exists to resist this erasure—not through force of law, but through the weight of record. It cannot prevent a man from lying. It can ensure that the lie is recorded beside the truth, such that those who come after may judge what was.</p>
            
            <p>The Ledger does not determine what was lawful. It determines what was done.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Limits of Record</h2>
            
            <p>The Ledger offers no protection. A name written in its pages grants no immunity from arrest, exile, or execution. An appointment recorded during a regency may be voided by a crowned King. A dismissal entered under emergency decree may be reversed the moment order is restored.</p>
            
            <p>The Ledger records authority exercised, not authority rightfully held. A coup is recorded the same as a coronation. The difference lies not in the ink, but in what comes after.</p>
            
            <p>Those who study the Ledger gain knowledge—of who held power, when, and by what claim. Whether that knowledge is used to legitimize, condemn, or contest is a question of politics, not of record-keeping.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Access to the Ledger</h2>
            
            <p>The Ledger is kept within the Royal Archives. It is not hidden, nor is it freely distributed. Those who hold office may review it. Those who seek to contest a claim may cite it. Those who investigate treason may call upon it as evidence.</p>
            
            <p>The Ledger does not speak for itself. It must be read, interpreted, and invoked. Knowledge of its contents is a form of power—fragile, but real.</p>
            
            <p>A Regent who appoints a dozen loyalists may believe their rule secure. The Ledger records each name. When the regency ends, the new King will know precisely who served the interregnum and who did not. Whether that knowledge brings reward or retribution is not the Ledger's concern.</p>

            <h3 style="color: var(--accent); margin-top: 0;">On the Nature of Institutional Memory</h3>
            <p>The Royal Archives of Britain have stood for generations. Kings have risen and fallen. Regents have governed and been cast down. Civil wars have been fought, and the victors have claimed the throne.</p>
            
            <p>Through all of this, the Ledger has endured—not because it is sacred, but because it is <em>useful</em>. Even tyrants prefer their actions recorded, for a record lends the appearance of order.</p>
            
            <p>The Ledger does not judge. It simply <em>remembers</em>. And memory, in a realm where power changes hands by force as often as by law, is the most dangerous record of all.</p>

                The Archives preserve. They do not forgive."
