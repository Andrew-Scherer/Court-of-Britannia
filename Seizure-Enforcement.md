# ⚔️ Seizure, Enforcement & Insolvency

**When Economic Pressure Becomes Force**

---


## What Is Seizure?

Seizure is the Crown's attempt to convert authority into resources through force. It is a deliberate political action that requires:


- Royal decree authorizing the action
- Formal notice to the target
- Public announcement of enforcement
- Guard participation (which may be refused)
- Online representation from the target

Seizure is **not** a Crown lien (which intercepts future income automatically). Seizure is a one-time confiscation attempt that may succeed or fail based on circumstances.


## Seizure Eligibility Checklist

Seizure may only occur when **ALL** of the following conditions are met:


## The Five-Phase Seizure Timeline

Seizure is not a single event. It is a phased escalation that gives all parties time to respond, negotiate, or resist.


### Phase 1: Assessment (Passive)


- Taxes are assessed by the Steward
- Debt accrues on the public Tax Ledger
- No force, no action


### Phase 2: Notice of Delinquency


- The Tax Envoy serves formal notice to the target
- Notice includes: amount owed, deadline, consequences if unpaid
- A copy is posted publicly (at court or on a notice board)
- This is the first roleplay-visible event


### Phase 3: Royal Decree


- If the debt remains unpaid, the King issues a decree authorizing enforcement
- The decree specifies: target, scope (gold, vendors, property), duration
- Guards are *permitted*, not *required*, to enforce
- Legitimacy is tested here—does the decree carry weight?


### Phase 4: Enforcement Window


- A public announcement is made declaring the time and location of enforcement
- The window is 2-4 hours, during peak server time
- This prevents ambushes and ensures witnesses


### Phase 5: Seizure Attempt

The Tax Envoy, backed by guards, arrives at the enforcement window. Possible outcomes:


## Offline Protection

Seizure actions may never be carried out while all authorized representatives of the target faction or guild are offline. This rule exists to prevent offline robbery disguised as law enforcement.


### What Happens If No Representative Is Online

If the enforcement window arrives but no authorized representative is present:


- Seizure is postponed
- Notices may be posted publicly at the property
- Vendors may be locked by decree
- Guards may secure the area
- A new enforcement window must be scheduled

This prevents factions from being deleted while players are offline, asleep, or unavailable.


## What May and May Not Be Seized


| Seizable Assets (in priority order) | Protected Assets (never seizable) |
|---|---|
| Gold from guild or faction TreasuryVendor proceeds held in escrowStored trade goods within the propertyProperty title (last resort, requires new decree) | Upkeep Ledger fundsPlayer personal banksPersonal inventories of offline playersArbitrary containers unrelated to the target entity |

This keeps seizure institutional (targeting organizations) rather than personal (targeting individuals).


## The Role of Guards

Guards are **permitted, not required**, to enforce economic decrees. This is fundamental to the legitimacy model.


### Guards May Choose


- Refuse to execute seizures
- Captains may stall or countermand
- The Marshal may intervene
- The Magistrate may challenge legal basis


> **❗ Note**
> **Critical Rule:** If guards decline to enforce, seizure fails materially—but this is not a system failure. It is legitimacy being tested.


### Why Guard Choice Matters

If guards decline:


- Seizure fails
- Crown looks weak
- Debt remains
- History is written
- Rivals gain confidence

This is not a failure—this is the system working correctly. Authority must be demonstrated, not assumed.


## Insolvency

Insolvency occurs when the Crown attempts seizure but finds no recoverable assets. The target's Treasury is empty, vendors have no proceeds, and no gold can be taken.


### What Insolvency Is Not


- Insolvency does not delete the faction or guild
- Insolvency does not evict the property
- Insolvency does not transfer ownership


> **❗ Note**
> **Doctrine:** An inability to collect assets does not dissolve, evict, or delete a guild or faction. It escalates the political situation.


### The Escalation Ladder

A failed seizure due to insolvency is recorded publicly. The Crown must then choose how to escalate:


### Declaring Insolvency

The Crown may formally declare a faction or guild insolvent. Effects:


- No deletion or eviction
- Severe trade penalties
- Reputation damage
- Third parties avoid dealing with them
- Creates internal faction pressure to raise funds


## Guilds vs Factions

The distinction between guilds and factions is critical to understanding seizure and eviction.


| Entity Type | Relationship to Crown | Seizure | Eviction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Guilds | Inside the civic compact. Accepted city jurisdiction. | May be seized from by decree. | May be evicted if unpaid and property is city-owned. |
| Factions | Sovereign entities. Operate outside formal city-state governance. | May be seized from by decree (as an act of force). | Cannot be evicted. May only be pressured, isolated, suppressed, or confronted. |


### Why This Distinction Exists

Guilds have accepted the Crown's authority by operating within its jurisdiction. Eviction is a legitimate consequence of failed obligations.

Factions have not accepted the Crown's authority. They are sovereign, contestable actors. The Crown may seize from them, sanction them, or wage war against them—but it cannot simply delete them by decree. Factions must be defeated, not administered away.


## Records & Transparency

All economic enforcement actions must be recorded and made public. Legitimacy is created by visibility, choice, and accountability.


### Public Records Include


- Tax assessments and debts (Tax Ledger)
- Notice of delinquency dates and responses
- Royal decrees authorizing enforcement
- Seizure attempts (successful or failed)
- Asset seizures (amount, date, witnesses)
- Insolvency declarations
- Guard participation or refusal

If a seizure happens in secret, it is not enforcement—it is theft. If guards refuse and it is not recorded, the system fails to capture what actually matters: the demonstration of power, or its absence.


## Summary


- Seizure is a political act requiring decree, notice, enforcement window, and guard participation
- All seven conditions must be met for seizure to be valid
- Offline representation is required—no surprise deletions
- Guards may refuse, causing seizure to fail materially
- Insolvency (empty treasury) does not delete factions—it triggers escalation
- Guilds may be evicted; factions cannot
- All enforcement actions are recorded publicly
- Seizure tests legitimacy—failure is part of the design
