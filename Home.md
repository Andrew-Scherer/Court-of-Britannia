# ⚔️ Kingdoms of Britannia

**A Permadeath Political Intrigue Shard for Ultima Online**

---

## Welcome to Britannia

This wiki documents the design systems for a revolutionary Ultima Online private shard where **death is permanent**, **power is political**, and **legitimacy is everything**.

Inspired by Game of Thrones, this shard transforms Britannia into a feudal tragedy simulator where every decision has weight, every alliance matters, and every death reshapes the world.

## Season 1: Britain Only

The shard launches with **Britain as the entire playable world**. This is intentional:

- **Density creates drama** — everyone shares the same spaces
- **Deaths are witnessed** — rumors spread fast
- **Political stakes feel immediate**
- **Small population feels intense, not empty**

Other cities exist in lore but are distant, abstract, and politically reactive rather than active. Britain is where power is decided.
