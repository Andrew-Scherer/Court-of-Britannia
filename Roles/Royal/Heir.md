# 👑 The Heir Presumptive

**"Claim Without Authority — Blood Without Power"**

---

> **Core Principle:** The Heir Presumptive holds **legitimacy, claim, and blood right** — but **NO King powers**. They are the *next in line*, not the ruler. The Crown transfers only at coronation.

---

## 📜 What Is an Heir?

An **Heir** is a player appointed by the King to be a **designated successor** to the throne. A King may name **up to three heirs**, ordered by precedence:

- **Primary Heir:** The favored successor — strongest legitimacy and first right to coronation
- **Secondary Heir:** The legitimate backup — inherits claim if Primary dies or is disqualified
- **Tertiary Heir:** The last resort — ensures continuity even in catastrophic succession crises

These appointments signal:

- **Legitimacy:** The King's official endorsement of these persons as next rulers
- **Ordered Precedence:** Clear hierarchy of who has the strongest claim
- **Dynasty Survival:** Multiple heirs protect against permadeath eliminating the line of succession
- **Future Authority:** The promise of power — *after coronation*

However, being named Heir does **not grant any King powers**. While the King lives, no Heir has authority to rule Britannia. They are claimants, not rulers.

---

## 👑 Why Name Multiple Heirs?

In a world of **permadeath**, succession is never guaranteed. A King names multiple heirs for strategic reasons:

### 1. Insurance Against Permadeath

If the Primary Heir dies permanently (assassination, battle, accident), the dynasty doesn't collapse. The Secondary Heir immediately becomes the strongest claimant.

### 2. Continuity During Crisis

Multiple heirs ensure that even if two successors die, a third remains to stabilize the realm and prevent total power vacuum.

### 3. Political Balance

Naming heirs from different factions can **balance competing powers** and prevent any single faction from dominating succession.

### 4. Hedge Against Betrayal

If the Primary Heir proves disloyal, incompetent, or compromised, the King has alternatives without abandoning succession plans entirely.

### 5. Fear of Extinction

Kings who fear their dynasty will die with them often name multiple heirs to ensure *someone* carries their legacy forward.

> **⚠️ The Cost of Multiple Heirs:** While multiple heirs increase dynasty survival, they **reduce succession certainty**. More heirs means more potential conflict, contested claims, and political maneuvering during succession. Each additional heir is both protection and danger.

## ⚔️ When the King Dies

When a King dies, **NO heir automatically becomes King**. Succession is *not* automatic. Instead:

1. **The Crown becomes vacant** — no one holds the Crown
2. **All named heirs become eligible candidates** — Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary heirs are all recognized claimants
3. **Heir precedence determines claim strength** — Primary has strongest claim, then Secondary, then Tertiary
4. If a **Regent exists, they govern in trust** — holding delegated authority until coronation
5. A **coronation timer begins** (3-7 days) — creating urgency to get crowned
6. **Coronation resolves which heir (if any) is crowned** — the first to coronation wins the Crown

> **⚠️ Critical:** All heirs hold **claim and legitimacy**, but **zero King powers**. They cannot issue edicts, command guards, or enforce laws until crowned. They are *symbols* without authority. The Crown transfers **only at coronation**.

### Heir Precedence: Who Has the Strongest Claim?

When multiple heirs exist, **precedence determines claim strength**:

| Heir Tier | Claim Strength | Political Position | Succession Right |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Primary Heir** | 🥇 Strongest | Favored successor — presumptive next ruler | First right to coronation. Most legitimate claimant. |
| **Secondary Heir** | 🥈 Strong | Legitimate backup — waiting for Primary to fail | If Primary dies or is disqualified, becomes strongest claimant. |
| **Tertiary Heir** | 🥉 Recognized | Last resort — insurance against total succession collapse | If Primary and Secondary both die, becomes strongest claimant. |

> **Important:** Precedence is *not* a mechanical lock. It determines **legitimacy and claim strength**, but does not prevent any heir from racing to coronation. A Tertiary Heir who reaches coronation *first* can become King, even if the Primary Heir survives.

### Succession Scenarios: What Happens to Each Heir?

**Scenario 1: All Three Heirs Survive**

- All three are eligible candidates with ordered precedence
- Primary Heir has strongest claim and political advantage
- Secondary and Tertiary may challenge, ally with Primary, or attempt their own coronation
- **Maximum succession tension** — three legitimate claimants competing for the Crown

**Scenario 2: Primary Heir Dies**

- Secondary Heir inherits strongest claim and becomes presumptive successor
- Tertiary Heir becomes the new backup heir
- Political landscape shifts — Secondary now has Primary's legitimacy

**Scenario 3: Primary and Secondary Both Die**

- Tertiary Heir becomes the **sole named heir** with strongest claim
- Dynasty survives catastrophic losses
- Tertiary's legitimacy is now undisputed among named heirs

**Scenario 4: All Three Heirs Die (Extinction Event)**

- No named heirs remain — **total succession collapse**
- **Claimants** (unofficial rivals) become the only path to succession
- Regent (if any) may seize the throne or civil war may erupt
- This is the nightmare scenario Kings name multiple heirs to prevent

> **⚠️ Permadeath Risk:** In a permadeath environment, multiple heirs are not paranoia — they are **dynasty insurance**. Assassination, battle, and accident can eliminate any claimant. Three heirs mean three chances to preserve the line of succession.

## 🛡️ What the Heir Presumptive Has

### ✅ The Heir Holds:

- **Strongest Claim:** Official designation as next ruler
- **Legitimacy:** Recognized by the previous King and (usually) the realm
- **Blood Right:** Lineage-based or merit-based claim endorsed by the Crown
- **Symbolic Authority:** Respect, deference, and political weight — but no enforcement power
- **First Right to Coronation:** Priority access to [[the coronation process|Becoming-King]]

### ❌ The Heir Does NOT Hold:

- **The Crown:** Only transfers at coronation
- **King Powers:** Cannot issue laws, commands, or enforce authority
- **Guaranteed Succession:** Must survive rivals, Regent, and Claimants to reach coronation
- **Regent Powers:** If a Regent exists, they hold delegated King authority — not the Heir

## ⚖️ Heir vs. Regent: The Power Imbalance

When both an **Heir** and a **Regent** exist after the King's death, a dangerous power imbalance emerges:

| Aspect | Heir Presumptive | Regent |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **Holds the Crown?** | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Claim to the Throne** | ✅ Strongest (official designation) | ❌ None (or contested) |
| **King Powers** | ❌ None | ✅ Full delegated authority |
| **Can Issue Edicts?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (stamped "REGENT AUTHORITY") |
| **Command Guards?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Block Coronations?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (if they control the realm) |
| **Can Self-Crown?** | ✅ Yes (if they can reach the coronation) | ✅ Yes (if they seize power) |

> **The Tension:** The Heir has *legitimacy*. The Regent has *authority*. This creates political intrigue, alliance-building, and potential conflict as the Heir must navigate the Regent's power to reach coronation.

See [[The Regent|Regent]] for details on Regent powers and limits.

## 🎯 The Heir's Challenges

An Heir Presumptive faces multiple threats on the path to coronation:

### 1. The Regent (Power Without Claim)

If a Regent exists, they may:

- **Block coronation:** Use their authority to delay or prevent the Heir from being crowned
- **Seize the throne:** Self-crown before the Heir can act
- **Manipulate the Heir:** Demand concessions, alliances, or loyalty in exchange for allowing coronation
- **Protect the Heir:** (Rare) Genuinely serve as a steward until the Heir is crowned

### 2. Claimants (Contested Blood)

**Claimants** are rival players with **contested or unofficial claims** to the throne. They may:

- Challenge the Heir's legitimacy
- Raise armies to contest succession
- Race to reach coronation first
- Attempt to assassinate the Heir

See [[Claimants|Claimant]] for more on how contested claims work.

### 3. The Coronation Timer (3-7 Days)

The longer the Heir waits, the more unstable the realm becomes:

- **Rivals gain ground:** Claimants and Regent may seize momentum
- **Chaos spreads:** Without a crowned King, the realm fractures
- **Accidents happen:** Political assassination, ambush, imprisonment

> **⏳ Time Pressure:** The coronation timer forces the Heir to act quickly — alliance-building, securing power, or racing to the coronation before rivals strike.

### 4. Assassination & Imprisonment

As the recognized successor, the Heir is a **high-value target**:

- Rivals may kill the Heir to clear their path to the throne
- A Regent may imprison the Heir to consolidate power
- Claimants may ambush the Heir before they reach coronation

---

## 🏆 Paths to the Throne

The Heir Presumptive has several paths to claim the Crown:

### 1. Peaceful Succession (Best Case)

- The Regent (if any) steps aside or supports the Heir
- No serious Claimants contest the succession
- The Heir reaches coronation safely and becomes King/Queen

> **✅ Ideal Outcome:** Smooth transfer of power. The Heir's legitimacy is undisputed, and they are crowned without conflict.

### 2. Political Negotiation

- The Heir must **negotiate with the Regent** for support or non-interference
- May involve promises, alliances, or concessions (e.g., "I'll keep you as Regent if you let me crown")
- The Heir leverages their legitimacy to build coalitions

### 3. Race to Coronation

- The Heir rushes to complete the coronation before the Regent or Claimants act
- High-risk, high-reward — success means becoming King, failure means losing power
- May involve bodyguards, secret routes, or surprise timing

### 4. Conflict & Uprising

- If the Regent blocks coronation, the Heir may **rally support** for an uprising
- Claimants may force the Heir into open conflict
- The Heir's legitimacy becomes a rallying cry for loyalists to overthrow the Regent

See [[Becoming King]] for full coronation mechanics.

## 🤝 Why a King Appoints Heirs

A wise King appoints heirs for strategic reasons:

### 1. Ensure Smooth Succession

Without named heirs, the King's death creates **chaos**. Unofficial Claimants may emerge, leading to civil war. Official heirs reduce uncertainty and provide legitimate succession paths.

### 2. Legitimize the Next Ruler

The King's endorsement grants heirs **symbolic authority** and makes them the presumptive next rulers in the eyes of the realm. This legitimacy is crucial during succession struggles.

### 3. Control Succession

Appointing heirs ensures the Crown passes to someone the King trusts — whether by blood, merit, or loyalty. Multiple heirs allow the King to balance different factions.

### 4. Prevent Power Vacuums

Heirs act as backup rulers if the King dies unexpectedly, reducing the risk of long-term [[Interregnum|Succession]]. Multiple heirs mean multiple safeguards against total succession collapse.

### 5. Political Signaling

Appointing heirs sends a message to the realm about who the King favors, creating alliances and deterring rivals. The **order of precedence** signals the King's priorities and strategic alignments.

### 6. Dynasty Insurance (Permadeath)

In a permadeath environment, no successor is guaranteed to survive. Multiple heirs are **survival insurance** — if one dies, another carries the dynasty forward. This is not paranoia, it's pragmatism.

---

## ❓ Can Heirs Be Revoked or Reordered?

**Yes.** While the King lives, they have absolute control over heir appointments:

### What the King Can Do:

- **Revoke any Heir status** — remove Primary, Secondary, or Tertiary at will
- **Reorder heir precedence** — promote Secondary to Primary, demote Primary to Tertiary, etc.
- **Replace heirs entirely** — appoint new heirs based on shifting politics or loyalty
- **Reduce the number of heirs** — go from three heirs to one, or eliminate all heirs entirely
- **Punish disloyalty** — remove Heir designation as political punishment

> **Strategic Heir Management:** A King may deliberately reorder heirs as a **political signal** — promoting loyal heirs, demoting suspected traitors, or balancing competing factions by shifting precedence.

### After the King Dies:

Once the King dies, **all heir designations are locked in**. The precedence at the moment of death determines claim strength during succession. No one can revoke or reorder heirs after the King is dead — only coronation resolves who becomes the next King.
