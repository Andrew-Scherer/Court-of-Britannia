# 👑 Becoming King

**The Crown Is Not Inherited — It Is Taken When the Coronation Succeeds**

---


## The Power of the Crown

The King is not "the strongest player" — they are the one whose decisions cannot be ignored without consequence. The Crown embodies legitimacy and represents the idea that Britannia has a center.


### Hard Powers


- **Appoint / remove high offices** — Regent, Marshal, and other key positions
- **Declare heirs** — Name legal successors to the throne
- **Grant / revoke land** — Control over specific royal properties through Land Commissioners and Stewards
- **Issue decrees** — Create binding commands and laws for the city. Enforcement through Guards.
- **Cancel executions and grant clemency**
- **Preside over ceremonies** — Legitimize events through presence
- **Mediate disputes** — Final arbiter in player conflicts
- **Represent Britain to the world** — Diplomatic authority


### Motivations


- Stay in power
- Be seen as rightful
- Prevent civil collapse
- Avoid being a puppet


### Goals


- Maintain loyalty of key offices
- Keep order without appearing tyrannical
- Control succession (or survive it)
- Decide when to act — and when not to


### Natural Conflicts

The Crown is never truly secure. Power attracts ambition, and those closest to the throne are often the first to challenge it:


- **Regent** — Holds power during transitions, may refuse to relinquish it
- **Heirs** — Designated successors with official claims, may grow impatient or be manipulated
- **Claimants** — Contenders with merit, force, or political backing who seek to seize the throne
- **Marshal** — Controls the guards, may value order through force over political stability

- **High-ranking nobles** — Ambitious courtiers who undermine quietly, building support for their own plays

**The question is never "if" the Crown will be challenged, but "when" and "by whom."**


> Player fantasy:Everyone watches what you do — and what you don't.


## The Core Principle


> *The crown is not inherited.It is taken — when the coronation succeeds.*

In Kingdoms of Britannia, there is **no automatic succession**. When a king dies, the Crown seat becomes vacant. No one has mechanical "King" powers until a coronation ceremony successfully completes.

What happens between death and coronation is where politics, violence, and legitimacy collide.

**→ For complete coronation mechanics, see Coronation Ceremony**


## Succession Overview: Coronation as Selection


> **Note**
> **📜 Upon the King's Death**
>
> **The Crown is vacant.** The Regent governs in trust. Named Heirs hold official claims in order of precedence. Claimants may assert contested claims through force or alliance.
> **The Crown transfers only at coronation**, where any eligible contender—Heir, Regent, or Claimant—may be crowned.
> **Legitimacy is determined not by mechanics, but by who recognizes the outcome.**


### Coronation Is About Selection, Not Transfer

The coronation is **not** a ceremony that transfers power from the dead King to the Heir. It is a **selection event** where one person—whoever successfully completes the ritual—becomes the new King.

**At the King's death, the following are eligible for coronation:**


> **Note**
> **✅ Named Heirs**
>
> **Official, ordered eligibility**
> - Primary Heir (first in line)
> - Secondary Heir (if Primary is dead or removed)
> - Tertiary Heir (if both above are unavailable)
> Named Heirs have **priority**, not **inevitability**. Their claim is recognized, but coronation is not guaranteed.
> **→ See Heir Presumptive for complete details**


> **Note**
> **⚔️ Claimants**
>
> **Unofficial, contested eligibility**
> Any player with a plausible claim to the throne—heritage, merit, conquest, or political backing—may attempt coronation. Their claim is **not officially recognized**, but they can physically reach the coronation and attempt the ritual.
> Claimants succeed through force, alliance, or by eliminating the Heir.
> **→ See Claimants for complete details**


> **Note**
> **⚖️ The Regent**
>
> **Procedural eligibility through custody of the state**
> The Regent holds all governing authority during the interregnum. They can officiate the coronation for the Heir—or crown themselves if circumstances allow. Their eligibility comes from **already holding power**, not from having a claim to the throne.
> **→ See The Regent for complete details**


### The Authority Layer (Who Holds Power Before Coronation)

Between the King's death and the coronation, power is distributed across three distinct layers:


| Role | Authority | Legitimacy | Claim |
|---|---|---|---|
| Regent | ✅ Full governing authority | ⚠️ Temporary only | ❌ None |
| Heir | ❌ None | ✅ Symbolic legitimacy | ✅ Official claim |
| Claimant | ❌ None (unless seized) | ⚠️ Contested | ⚠️ Unofficial claim |


> The Triangle of Drama:Heir= Legitimacy without powerRegent= Power without claimClaimant= Claim without powerThis triangle is the engine of succession drama. Each role needs what the others have.

## The Six Legitimate Paths to the Throne

A king can emerge through any of these paths. Most successful reigns rely on two or more.


## The Regent: King-in-Function, Not King-in-Law


> Core Rule:A Regent may rule. Only a crowned monarch may reign.

When the King dies, a Regent may automatically activate (if previously designated) or be assumed by a predefined role (Chancellor, Marshal, Council-appointed). The Regent gains **Limited Crown Powers** to keep Britain functioning.


### What a Regent IS


- The temporary wielder of crown authority
- Responsible for stability
- Able to issue orders, command guards, convene courts
- Able to keep Britain running


### What a Regent is NOT


- Legitimate ruler
- Guaranteed successor
- Immune from challenge
- Safe from coronation conflict
- Protected from accusation

**They hold power without legitimacy.** That's the tension.


### Limited King Powers


| Regent CAN | Regent CANNOT |
|---|---|
| Command the guard | Declare themselves king by default |
| Maintain order | Permanently alter succession |
| Issue temporary decrees | Revoke noble status |
| Schedule a coronation | Retroactively legitimize their reign |
| Appoint interim offices | End the interregnum without coronation |
| Act "in the name of the realm" | - |


> **Note**
> **The Natural Conflict: Regent vs Heir**
>
> **The Heir's Position:**
> - "I am the rightful successor"
> - "The regent is overreaching"
> - "This delay is illegitimate"
> **The Regent's Position:**
> - "I am keeping the realm safe"
> - "The heir is unfit / weak / absent"
> - "We cannot rush the crown"
> **Both are right. Neither is safe.**


## The Three Phases of Succession

A king is not decided in one moment. They pass through three distinct phases:


## The Coronation Ceremony


> The Only Mechanical Gate:There is no king until a coronation succeeds.

Support should be RP'd. The outcome of the coronation ceremony determines who the king is. If multiple claimants arrive at the coronation ceremony expecting to be crowned king, there will be conflict.


### The Rules (Simple and Brutal)


- The ceremony happens at a specific location (Britain Castle throne room)
- A Coronation NPC or object exists (Crown, throne, relic, banner)
- Only one person can complete the coronation action
- The action takes time (channeling / ritual / speech)
- The action is interruptible
- The action is public

**That's it.** No votes. No tallies. No UI polls.


### What Happens If Multiple Claimants Show Up?


> **Note**
> **Case A: Only One Claimant Arrives**
>
> - Ceremony completes
> - King role is assigned
> - Guards, court, and mechanics lock in
> Clean, quiet, believable.


> **Note**
> **Case B: Multiple Claimants Arrive**
>
> **Now it becomes Ultima Online at its best:**
> - Arguments
> - Declarations
> - Guards choosing sides
> - Assassinations
> - Open battle
> - Chaos, but contained to a moment
> **Eventually:**
> - One claimant is dead, flees, is arrested, or loses guard support
> - The surviving claimant completes the coronation
> - Mechanics engage
> - The crown becomes real
> **This is perfect RP.**


### Why Guards Decide the Outcome (And Why That's OK)

Guards don't auto-side with the heir. Guards side with whoever they've already been obeying. Which means:


- All the RP before the coronation mattered
- The ceremony just reveals the result

This mirrors history perfectly. **Violence is political, not random.**


### What If the Coronation Fails?

Even better. If:


- The heir dies
- The hall turns into a massacre
- Guards split
- The ceremony can't complete

**Then:** Britain enters Interregnum. No king. Power fragments. Chaos escalates.

**That's not a failure state. That's content.**


## Common Pretexts for Challenging an Heir

Why would someone say the heir is illegitimate? Here are believable reasons:


- The heir was born before a marriage
- The heir was secretly adopted
- The heir broke an oath
- The heir committed a crime
- The heir is unfit (madness, cowardice, heresy)
- The naming decree was invalid
- The king was coerced


> **❗ Note**


## Who Can Step Into the Throne?

Anyone who can convince **three of these five** to support them:


1. 🛡 **The Guard**
2. ⚖️ **The Law**
3. 🖋 **The Narrative** (Court opinion)
4. 🤝 **Key Offices** (Chancellor, Advisors)
5. 🌊 **The Public** (or at least prevent unrest)

The heir usually starts with 1–2. A successful challenger assembles 3+.


## Summary: The Single Rule


> *The throne does not pass automatically.It passes to whoever can make their rule unquestioned.*


> Secondary Rule:A king is not chosen by the system. The system only acknowledges a king once the world already has.

**What this means in practice:**


- Kings can reign for months
- Heirs are never "safe"
- Commoners can ascend
- Force isn't enough
- Law matters but can be bent
- Narrative is a weapon

**Most importantly:** Succession is not a mechanic. It is a crisis that players must navigate.


> **❗ Note**
> **Why This Won't Anger the Player Base**
>
> Players aren't mad when they lost. They're mad when they feel cheated.
> This system avoids that because:
> - The struggle was visible
> - The signals were clear
> - The ratification matched reality
> People might say: "I hated that king."
> But they won't say: "The system screwed us."
> **That's the difference.**
