**Britain's Field Agents — Carrying Authority to the Edges**

---


## Role Overview


| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Position | Envoy of Britain |
| Number of Positions | 3 maximum |
| Appointed By | The Emissary of the Crown |
| Reports To | The Emissary of the Crown |
| Superior | Emissary of the Crown (appointed by King) |
| Function | Field delivery and witnessing on behalf of Britain |


## Hierarchy & Structure


## What Envoys Actually Do


### They Deliver:


- Recognition (official acknowledgment of faction legitimacy)
- Demands (tribute requirements, compliance orders)
- Warnings (escalation notices, consequences)
- Ultimatums (final notices before action)


### They Witness:


- Fealty oaths (sworn allegiance to Britain)
- Withdrawals (revocation of recognition)
- Public refusals (faction rejections of Britain's authority)


### They Report:


- Faction responses to the Emissary of the Crown
- Witnessed events for the Interfaction Chronicle
- Incidents, threats, or attacks on their person
- Requests for escalation or clarification


## Why This Role Matters

Envoys don't have less authority than the Emissary of the Crown in the field — they *are* Britain's authority when delivering proclamations. The difference is organizational: Envoys report to the Emissary of the Crown, who coordinates and escalates.


## Critical Canon Rule


> **❗ Note**
> 
> **Harming an Envoy is never "just PvP."
>                 It is a political act Britain must respond to.**
> 

This means:


- Attacking an Envoy creates casus belli
- Killing an Envoy justifies immediate retaliation
- Interfering with Envoy business is a crime against Britain
- PKs have a choice: violence → consequences

**Envoys share the same protections as the Emissary of the Crown.** Harming either is equally serious politically. Britain does not distinguish between attacking a high-ranking or low-ranking representative — both are attacks on Britain itself.


## What Envoys Are NOT


- ❌ Negotiators (they don't make deals)
- ❌ Diplomats (they don't create policy)
- ❌ Ambassadors (they don't represent faction interests)
- ❌ Messengers (they carry state authority, not personal messages)
- ❌ Subordinate in authority (when delivering, they speak for Britain)
- ❌ Invulnerable (they can be harmed, with consequences)


## Powers & Limitations


### Powers


- Deliver official Britain proclamations (as directed by Emissary of the Crown)
- Witness and record faction responses
- Report directly to the Emissary of the Crown
- Legal protection under Britain's law (equal to Emissary of the Crown)
- Authority to demand audiences with faction leaders


### Limitations


- Cannot make promises or deals
- Cannot alter Britain's position
- Cannot recognize or outlaw factions (only deliver such proclamations)
- Cannot enforce (that's the Guards' role)
- Cannot retreat from witnessing (refusal to witness is dereliction)
- Cannot appoint other Envoys (only the Emissary of the Crown can)


## Optional Visual Markers

For enforcement clarity, Envoys may carry:


- Tabard (official Britain colors)
- Royal Seal (proof of authority)
- Color sash (visible identification)
- Scroll case (for official documents)

*Not mandatory, but it helps prevent "I didn't know." Visual markers should distinguish Envoys from Emissary of the Crown (different color sash, smaller seal, etc.) while still showing Britain's authority.*


## Appointment & Dismissal


### Appointment


- **Appointed by:** The Emissary of the Crown
- **Number:** 3 maximum
- **Term:** At the Emissary of the Crown's pleasure
- **Requirements:** Trust, communication skill, willingness to travel


### Dismissal


- **Dismissed by:** The Emissary of the Crown or the King
- **Reasons:** Failure to deliver, unauthorized negotiation, corruption, dereliction
- **Effect:** Loss of all emissary protections and authority


## Relationship with Emissary of the Crown


## How This Creates Gameplay


## Example Scenarios


### Scenario 1: Routine Tribute Demand

An Envoy travels to a faction base to deliver a tribute demand. The faction leader pays immediately. The Envoy witnesses the payment, records it, and reports success to the Emissary of the Crown. Simple, clean, documented.


### Scenario 2: Hostile Reception

An Envoy delivers a warning to a faction. The faction leader refuses to meet. The Envoy publicly announces the warning at the faction's gate, witnesses the refusal to appear, and reports. This refusal is recorded in the Interfaction Chronicle as evidence of non-compliance.


### Scenario 3: Envoy Attacked

A faction member attacks an Envoy en route to deliver an ultimatum. The Envoy survives and reports to the Emissary of the Crown. The Emissary of the Crown escalates to the King. Britain declares the attack an act of war and withdraws all recognition. The Envoy's wound becomes casus belli.


### Scenario 4: Coordinated Deliveries

The Emissary of the Crown directs all 3 Envoys to deliver simultaneous ultimatums to three different factions. This demonstrates Britain's reach and forces coordinated responses. The Emissary of the Crown remains in Britain to brief the King on results as they arrive.


## Summary

Envoys are Britain's field representatives, appointed by the Emissary of the Crown to deliver proclamations, witness faction responses, and report back. They carry the same authority as the Emissary of the Crown when delivering Britain's position, but report to the Emissary of the Crown organizationally.

Harming an Envoy is never "just PvP" — it is a political act that Britain must respond to. Envoys are not powerful people, but they are dangerous to touch.

This role creates distributed presence, escalation flexibility, and witness redundancy without requiring new mechanics. Envoys are the eyes, ears, and voice of Britain in faction territories.
