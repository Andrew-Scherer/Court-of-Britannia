# 🛡️ Civic Guard System
**Authority Through Force and Restraint**

---

## 🏛️ Guard Philosophy
Guards are the visible expression of current political power. They enforce decrees, control violence, and maintain order. They serve authority as it exists in practice—following orders until they choose not to. This makes them both essential to stability and a potential threat to any ruler.

## 🎖️ The Guard Hierarchy

| Rank | Limit | Appointed By | Can Appoint | Authority |
|------|-------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Marshal of the Guard** | 1 | The King | Captains | Supreme Command |
| **Captain of the Guard** | ~3 | Marshal | City Guards | Field Leadership |
| **City Guard** | Unlimited | Captain | None | Frontline Enforcement |

### 1. Marshal of the Guard
The supreme commander of Britain's forces. Sets enforcement policy and rules of engagement.
- **The King's Check**: A disloyal Marshal can isolate the King or seize power personally. During succession, the Marshal's choice often decides who keeps the throne.

### 2. Captain of the Guard
Mid-tier command that ensures operational continuity.
- **Loyalty Networks**: Captains recruit guards directly, creating personal bonds that can fracture the force during political crises.

### 3. City Guard
The face of authority on the street.
- **Discretion**: Guards decide whose violations matter. Selective enforcement (e.g., favors for nobles) is a political reality that reflects the regime's values.

## ⚖️ Use of Force & Arrests

### Non-Lethal (Default)
Guards aim to incapacitate, not kill. Downed suspects are shackled and transported to Britain Jail. This preserves the possibility of trial and demonstrates regime restraint.

### Lethal Force (Exceptional)
Justified ONLY for:
- Direct threats to the Crown.
- Violent resistance where subdual has failed.
- Explicit Royal Decree for lethal action.
- **Review**: The Coroner investigates all guard-involved deaths. Unjustified killings are treated as Murder.

### Arrest Procedure
1. **Cause**: Crime witnessed or Decree issued.
2. **Subdual**: Combat to incapacitate the suspect.
3. **Binding**: Using [Shackles] to secure the prisoner.
4. **Transport**: Manual escort to Britain Jail.

## ⚔️ Political Risk: The Guard Split
Guards follow people, not just offices. In a succession crisis or civil conflict, the guard force may fracture:
- Some follow the Marshal.
- Some follow specific Captains.
- Some remain neutral or defect.
**When guards hesitate, authority collapses.**
