**The Visible Face of Authority**

---


## Role Overview


| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Position | City Guard |
| Number of Positions | Unlimited |
| Appointed By | Captain of the Guard |
| Can Appoint | None |
| Reports To | Captains and Marshal |
| Function | Patrol, arrest, enforce decrees, respond to violence, maintain order |


## What City Guards Do

Guards conduct patrols, make arrests, respond to violence, and deliver prisoners to custody. They interpret orders from Captains and the Marshal, making daily decisions about when to intervene, whom to arrest, and how much force to use.

**These decisions are nominally guided by law and decree, but in practice guards exercise significant discretion.**


> Guards are where policy meets reality. They decide whose violations matter.


## Core Duties


### Patrols and Presence


- **Conduct regular patrols** — Maintain visible presence in assigned areas
- **Observe suspicious activity** — Watch for signs of crime, disorder, or threats
- **Respond to calls for assistance** — Investigate reports from citizens
- **Deter crime through visibility** — Presence alone prevents many violations


### Arrests and Enforcement


- **Witness violations** — Observe crimes or decree violations directly
- **Confront suspects** — Issue warnings or commands to comply
- **Subdue resistance** — Use force to incapacitate and capture
- **Bind and transport prisoners** — Secure suspects and deliver them to jail
- **Document arrests** — Record who was arrested, why, where, and when


### Order Maintenance


- **Intervene in public violence** — Stop fights, riots, or disturbances
- **Control crowds** — Manage gatherings that risk becoming chaotic
- **Protect officials** — Provide security for Crown, Magistrate, executions
- **Control access to restricted areas** — Guard castle, treasury, jail entrances


## Discretion and Power

Guards hold more power than official descriptions suggest. Every arrest involves judgment calls:


### Questions Guards Answer Every Day


- **Is this worth arresting?** — Warning vs arrest for minor violations
- **Do I pursue or let them go?** — Chase fleeing suspects or prioritize other duties
- **How much force is justified?** — Restraint vs escalation in subduing resistance
- **Whose complaint do I investigate?** — Noble vs commoner; ally vs enemy
- **Do I enforce this decree?** — Some laws matter more than others

**This discretion makes guards political actors, not mechanical enforcers.**


### Selective Enforcement


> **Note**
> Guards do not enforce decrees uniformly. They prioritize:
> - Nobles over commoners
> - Allies over enemies
> - Visible order over hidden crimes
> - Captain's priorities over written law
> **When a noble breaks curfew and receives a warning while a commoner is jailed for the same act, the disparity becomes evidence of the regime's values.**
> The public remembers these disparities.


## Recruitment and Loyalty

Captains choose whom to appoint as guards, creating networks of loyalty that may not align with the Crown's interests.


### Who Becomes a Guard?


- Those seeking steady employment and authority
- Commoners wanting to rise above their station
- Allies of specific Captains building loyalty networks
- Former criminals seeking legitimacy
- Nobles securing positions for political leverage


### Guard Loyalty

Guards owe loyalty to multiple authorities with potentially conflicting interests:


| Authority | Relationship |
|---|---|
| Captain who appointed them | Personal loyalty; most immediate authority |
| Marshal | Ultimate guard commander; sets policy |
| The Crown | Source of legitimacy; distant authority |
| Fellow guards | Solidarity and mutual protection |

When these authorities conflict, guards often follow the Captain who appointed them over distant orders from the Marshal or Crown.


## Use of Force


### Non-Lethal Force (Default)

Guards engage combatants with intent to incapacitate and capture:


- Target is reduced to downed state, not killed
- Guard binds and transports to jail
- Preserves possibility of trial and sentencing
- Demonstrates regime restraint


### Lethal Force (Exceptional)

Justified under narrow conditions:


- Direct threat to Crown or key noble
- Violent resistance where subdual has failed
- Defense of self or other guards
- Execution of standing order explicitly authorizing lethal response

**Use of lethal force does not make guards immune to review.** If a guard kills someone under questionable circumstances, the Coroner investigates and the Magistrate may bring charges.


> **❗ Note**


## Accountability and Records

Every arrest produces a record:


- Guard name and rank
- Prisoner name
- Stated charges or cause for arrest
- Location and time
- Witnesses present, if any

These records are maintained by the Warden and accessible to the Magistrate and Crown. They serve as evidence in trials, audits of guard conduct, and historical documentation of regime enforcement patterns.


### Review of Conduct

Guards may be held accountable through:


- **Legal review** — Magistrate investigates complaints of unlawful arrest or excessive force
- **Coroner investigation** — Deaths caused by guards are investigated; unjustified killings treated as murder
- **Dismissal** — Marshal, Captain, or King may dismiss guards for cause
- **Public scrutiny** — Public attention to guard actions affects recruitment and loyalty

Accountability does not guarantee justice, but it creates evidence. A guard who repeatedly kills prisoners "while resisting arrest" creates a pattern. A regime that ignores such patterns loses legitimacy.


## Crisis Situations and Guard Choices


### Conflicting Orders

When different authorities issue contradictory commands, guards must choose:


- **Captain says arrest, Magistrate says unlawful** — Obey immediate superior or legal authority?
- **Marshal orders one thing, Captain another** — Follow chain of command up or sideways?
- **King and claimant both issue decrees** — Pick a side in succession crisis

**There is no mechanical resolution. Guards choose, and their choice reveals where power actually resides.**


### Succession Crises

When Britain's authority fragments, individual guards face an impossible question: **Whom do I serve?**

Guards typically follow their Captain's choice, but not always:


- Some guards follow personal conviction over orders
- Some desert rather than choose
- Some switch sides as power shifts
- Some remain neutral and are forced to choose later

When guards hesitate to follow orders or "lose" prisoners, authority has already collapsed—even if the throne is still occupied.


## Why Play This Role?

City Guards are for players who want:


- **Frontline enforcement** — Be the visible face of authority on the street
- **Daily discretion** — Make judgment calls about arrests, force, and priorities
- **Patrol autonomy** — Operate independently during patrols
- **Entry to guard hierarchy** — Learn the system, potentially rise to Captain or Marshal
- **Political leverage through numbers** — Guards matter collectively; one guard can tip the balance in a crisis

**This is the entry-level enforcement role with significant practical authority and political relevance.**


## Summary


- City Guards conduct patrols, make arrests, and maintain order in Britain
- Appointed by Captains; unlimited positions available
- Exercise significant discretion in enforcement, making them political actors
- Default to non-lethal force; lethal force requires justification and review
- Selective enforcement creates visible evidence of regime values
- Loyalty flows to the Captain who appointed them, creating factional networks
- Every arrest creates a record subject to review by Magistrate and Crown
- During crises, individual guards choose which authority to follow
- Entry point to guard hierarchy with path to Captain or Marshal
