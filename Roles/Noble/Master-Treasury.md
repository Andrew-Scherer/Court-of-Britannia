# 💰 Master of the Treasury

**The Price of Power**

---


## Core Function

The Master of the Treasury is the Crown's chief fiscal officer.

They do not rule.  

        They do not command force.  

        They do not set salaries.

They shape the economic reality the Crown must govern.

Their authority lies in policy exposure, forecasting, and consequence, not direct control.


## Appointment & Removal


| Action | Authority |
|---|---|
| Appointed by | TheKing |
| Removed by | TheKing |


### During Regency


- The [[Regent|Regent]] may appoint or remove the Master of the Treasury only while exercising Crown authority
- All actions are tagged as Regency Acts and subject to reversal upon coronation

There is typically one Master of the Treasury.

Scarcity is intentional.


## Sovereign Boundary (Critical)


> **❗ Note**

They propose fiscal policy.  

        The Crown authorizes it — explicitly or implicitly.

Taxation remains a power of the Crown.


## Primary Powers


### 1️⃣ Tax Policy Proposals (Input Side Control)

The Master of the Treasury may propose tax rates that affect:


- Property sales at auction
- NPC purchased goods
- Player sold goods through vendors
- Other system-defined city revenue sources

**They do not collect taxes manually.**  

        All taxes are automatic and logged.


### 2️⃣ The 24-Hour Ratification Rule (Core Mechanic)

Every tax proposal enters a 24-hour review window.

**During this window:**

The King or acting Regent may:


- Approve
- Approve with Modifications
- Reject

**If no Crown action is taken within 24 hours:**

The proposal is automatically enacted by default.

This represents:


- Administrative inertia
- Crown neglect
- Silent consent


> **Note**
> - Who proposed the policy
> - When the window opened
> - Whether the Crown intervened
> - Whether enactment was explicit or automatic

No proposal can remain pending indefinitely.


### 3️⃣ Treasury Visibility (Ledger Authority)

The Master of the Treasury has full read access to the Royal Treasury Ledger, including:


- Current treasury balance
- Daily inflow (taxes, fees)
- Daily outflow (wages, bounties, system sinks)
- Payroll projections
- Deficit forecasts

**This visibility is not power — it is accountability.**


### 4️⃣ Insolvency Forecasting & Warnings

The Master may publish formal fiscal warnings, such as:


- "At current policy, guard payroll exceeds revenue."
- "Projected partial wages within 72 hours."
- "Treasury depletion expected within three days."

These warnings:


- Do not force action
- Do not block systems
- Create political pressure
- Attach accountability to inaction

Ignoring warnings is allowed — and consequential.


### 5️⃣ Recommendation Authority (Not Enforcement)

The Master may recommend:


- Tax increases or reductions (directly through enacting proposals)
- Spending restraint (through conversation and play)
- Guard force reductions (through conversation and play)
- Salary band adjustments (via constitutional mechanisms)

They cannot enforce these recommendations.

They are the messenger — not the executioner.


## Explicit Non-Powers (Design Safeguards)

The Master of the Treasury **cannot**:


| Prohibited Action | Reason |
|---|---|
| ❌ Set individual salaries | Prevents favoritism and micromanagement |
| ❌ Grant exemptions | Prevents corruption and special treatment |
| ❌ Collect taxes manually | Prevents selective enforcement |
| ❌ Decide who gets paid | Prevents weaponization of payroll |
| ❌ Block wage payments | Prevents role paralysis |
| ❌ Seize treasury funds | Prevents embezzlement mechanics |
| ❌ Target individuals or groups | Prevents harassment via taxation |
| ❌ Override the Crown | Preserves sovereign boundary |

This prevents favoritism, micromanagement, and finance-simulator burnout.


## Relationship to Other Roles


### Crown (King / Regent)


- The Crown owns final authority
- The Master creates fiscal reality
- Automatic ratification makes silence expensive


> The Treasury proposes. The Crown disposes — or is judged for silence.


### Guards & Marshal


- Guard expansion increases treasury burden automatically
- Payroll pressure becomes political leverage
- The Master does not hire, fire, or command guards
- Guards feel fiscal stress without being directly managed


### Citizens & Merchants

Tax policy makes merchants political actors by default:


- High taxes push trade outside city walls
- Black markets emerge naturally
- Merchants lobby the Crown
- Smuggling becomes economically rational

The Master never creates this manually — policy does.


## Political Effects of Tax Policy


| Tax Rate | Effect |
|---|---|
| High Property Taxes | Raises cost of living for residents; reduces auction activity |
| High Vendor Taxes | Creates black markets; facilitates personal player trade outside city |
| Low Taxes Across Board | Encourages trade; may starve treasury and cause wage failures |
| Differential Rates | Incentivizes moving trade outside city walls; accommodates criminal activity |


## Why This Role Exists (System Purpose)

The Master of the Treasury exists to ensure:


- Prosperity is felt
- Collapse is visible
- Power has a price
- Inaction creates fallout
- No one can quietly mismanage the city

They convert numbers into pressure.


## Offline Continuity

**If no one is online:**


- Taxes continue to apply
- Ledgers update
- Payroll expectations form
- Insolvency clocks tick

**When players return:**


- They react to what happened — not decide whether it happened


## Failure States (All Intentional)


| Failure Scenario | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Crown ignores proposal | Automatic enactment → political backlash |
| Taxes too high | Trade flight → black markets → unrest |
| Taxes too low | Unpaid roles like guards → instability |
| Treasury collapse | Legitimacy crisis → political consequence |


> **✅ Note**


## Canon Summary


> **Note**
> The Master of the Treasury is an officer of the Crown responsible for fiscal policy, forecasting, and transparency.
> They propose taxation and publish financial warnings, but do not command enforcement or set wages.
> Tax proposals become law if not challenged by the Crown within twenty-four hours.
> Silence is consent. Collapse is remembered.


## One-Line Lock-In Rule


> The Master controls fiscal truth.The Crown controls fiscal action.The realm judges the result.
