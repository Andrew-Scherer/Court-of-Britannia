**Buildings as Political Weapons**

## 🏘️ Role Overview
The Land Commissioner wields mechanical power over the land, buildings, and residency within Britain. This role is a double-edged sword: highly powerful, yet highly visible and accountable.

## 📜 Powers & Responsibilities
- **Eviction Authority**: May execute physical evictions and place notices on properties.
- **Property Claims**: Handles deeding and grants for open properties.
- **Ledger Maintenance**: Manages the [Land Ledger] and Registry of Estates.
- **Royal Orders**: Implements the King's will regarding Royal Property.

### The Legitimacy Rule
**Mechanical power ALWAYS works. Legitimacy determines if you survive using it.**
- If you evict a popular noble without a Royal Order, the action takes effect, but you may face immediate dismissal, trial, or retaliation.

## 🛡️ Protections & Safeguards
- **Manual Intervention**: Land actions require a physical official to interact with the property. This prevents "auto-eviction" and forces a human decision.
- **Full Action Logging**: Every deed and eviction is recorded in the public [Land Ledger] with the name of the official.
- **24-Hour Challenge Window**: The King or a Court may challenge and reverse unauthorized land actions within 24 hours.

## 🏘️ Interaction with Royal Property
- **Role-Linked Offices**: Certain properties (Barracks, Treasury, Jail) are linked to specific roles. The Commissioner ensures these access rights update instantly when officials change.
- **Royal Tenure**: The Commissioner manages discretionary access to palaces and secondary royal chambers on behalf of the Crown using a two-zone model:
    - **Public Zones (Great Halls, Courtyards)**: Open to all by default. Presence is never a violation, encouraging social play and observation. Guards do not enforce trespassing here.
    - **Private Zones (Bedchambers, Vaults)**: Explicit tenure access is required. It grants mechanical co-ownership (interaction rights) within the zone. If a character lacks access, the mechanical boundary is absolute.
