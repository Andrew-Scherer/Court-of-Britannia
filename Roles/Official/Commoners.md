# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Commoner & Non-Office Gameplay

**The Audience That Makes Power Real**

---


> *If elites are the actors, commoners are the audience.And an audience that reacts, remembers, whispers, and turns — decides whether the play succeeds.*

Commoners are not "less important." They are **the pressure that makes power real**.


## What Commoners Actually Do


> **Note**
> **1. They Are the Audience (And That Is Power)**
>
> When a decree is issued or trial happens:
> - Who cheers? Who mutters? Who throws rotten fruit?
> - Is the crowd hostile, sympathetic, or afraid?
> Elites need public response to validate their actions. A beggar who spits at a decree matters more than a noble who nods.


> **Note**
> **2. They Are the Witnesses**
>
> Commoners see arrests, beatings, who was spared, who was ignored. They spread:
> - Firsthand accounts
> - Distorted versions
> - Emotionally charged rumors
> This directly feeds Courtiers, Minax, and Populists. A commoner saying "That's not how it happened" can destroy a narrative.


> **Note**
> **3. They Force Elites to Justify Themselves**
>
> Examples:
> - "Why was he executed but she was spared?"
> - "Why does the Guard protect nobles but not us?"
> - "Why is sanctuary denied now?"
> A beggar asking the wrong question in public is dynamite.


> **Note**
> **4. They Are the Recruiting Pool**
>
> Every major arc pulls from commoners:
> - Guards recruit from residents
> - Courtiers spot clever commoners
> - Minax recruits the disillusioned
> - Chaos recruits the angry
> A commoner is not stuck. They are **uncommitted potential**.

## Why Commoner Gameplay Matters

Many players will choose to stay commoners permanently because there's no pressure to "win" — only to react and survive. Commoners have immense social power without admin responsibility. You can provoke, witness, gossip, ask dangerous questions, and force elites to justify themselves.

Without commoners, the game becomes a small group of administrators managing systems. With commoners, it becomes a society where every action has an audience that remembers.
