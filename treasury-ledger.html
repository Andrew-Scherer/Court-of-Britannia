            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Constitutional Statement:</strong></p>
                <p>"Visibility is not power. It is accountability."</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The Royal Treasury Ledger does not move gold. It does not authorize spending. It does not approve policy. It does not grant exemptions or enforce austerity.</p>

        <!-- What the Royal Treasury Ledger Is -->
        <section>
            <h2>What the Royal Treasury Ledger Is</h2>
            <p>The Royal Treasury Ledger is a <strong>read-only financial record</strong>. It reflects the current and historical state of the city treasury. It exists independently of who is online. It updates automatically through system events.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Operational Rules:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>No manual entries</li>
                <li>No discretionary edits</li>
                <li>No retroactive corrections</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The ledger observes reality. It does not construct it.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- What the Ledger Shows -->
        <section>
            <h2>What the Ledger Shows (Authoritative Scope)</h2>
            <p>The Master of the Treasury and the Crown have full read access to the following information:</p>
            
            <h3>Current State</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Current treasury balance</strong> — the gold available at this moment</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Inflow</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Daily tax revenue (aggregated):</strong> Total collected from all tax categories</li>
                <li><strong>NPC fees and premiums:</strong> Revenue captured from system purchases</li>
                <li><strong>Property-related income:</strong> Taxes on land sales and transfers</li>
                <li><strong>Other system-generated revenue:</strong> Fines, bounties, and miscellaneous city income</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Outflow</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Daily wage payouts:</strong> Actual gold paid to all seated roles</li>
                <li><strong>Bounty payments:</strong> Rewards distributed through the justice system</li>
                <li><strong>Other automatic system sinks:</strong> Governance costs and city expenses</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Projection Layer</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Payroll projections based on filled roles:</strong> Expected daily wage obligations under current staffing</li>
                <li><strong>Deficit forecasts under current policy:</strong> Projected timeline to shortfall if revenue trends continue</li>
                <li><strong>Estimated days until partial or failed wages:</strong> Warning threshold for insolvency</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Critical Limitation:</strong></p>
            <p>Forecasts are informational. They do not block policy. They do not force action. They provide visibility, not control.</p>

        <!-- Political Function of Treasury Visibility -->
        <section>
            <h2>Political Function of Treasury Visibility</h2>
            <p>Visibility creates political pressure. The Royal Treasury Ledger does not enforce consequences — it makes consequences undeniable.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Effects of Ledger Visibility:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Warnings become credible:</strong> The Master of the Treasury can cite exact balances and projected timelines</li>
                <li><strong>Insolvency cannot be denied:</strong> When the treasury balance reaches zero, the ledger records it</li>
                <li><strong>Underpayment becomes public fact:</strong> Failed wage payments appear in the ledger with timestamps</li>
                <li><strong>Leadership absorbs blame for outcomes:</strong> The ledger does not judge — it provides evidence for others to judge</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Critical Limitations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Master of the Treasury cannot fix shortfalls alone — only the Crown can authorize policy changes</li>
                <li>Silence is itself a political choice — inaction is recorded as tacit acceptance of consequences</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The ledger does not create political will. It removes the excuse of ignorance.</p>

        <!-- Offline Continuity Rule -->
        <section>
            <h2>Offline Continuity Rule</h2>
            <p>The Royal Treasury Ledger operates continuously, regardless of player presence.</p>
            
            <p><strong>While No One Is Online:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ledger updates continue</li>
                <li>Revenue accrues automatically</li>
                <li>Wages attempt to pay on schedule</li>
                <li>Shortfalls record automatically</li>
                <li>Projections recalculate based on current data</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>When Players Return:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>They respond to recorded reality</li>
                <li>They do not decide whether events occurred</li>
                <li>They do not retroactively adjust outcomes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The city's fiscal state does not pause when leadership is absent. The ledger reflects what happened, not what was convenient.</p>
