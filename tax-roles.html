        <!-- Philosophy -->
        <section>
            <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Economic governance in Britain is not centralized in a single office. Taxation authority is distributed across multiple roles, each with distinct powers and explicit non-powers. No single actor can tax, collect, and enforce unilaterally.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Core Principle:</strong></p>
                <p>"Economic enforcement requires coordination, not command."</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>This distribution serves several purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prevents abuse:</strong> No individual can unilaterally empty faction banks or impose punitive seizures</li>
                <li><strong>Creates accountability:</strong> Multiple parties must cooperate, making actions visible and contestable</li>
                <li><strong>Forces political choices:</strong> Guards may refuse, magistrates may intervene, officials may resign</li>
                <li><strong>Preserves roleplay:</strong> Economic actions are political theater, not mechanical clicks</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The following sections define each role's authority, limits, and interaction points within the tax and enforcement system.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Diplomatic Corps (Tax Enforcement) -->
        <section>
            <h2>The Diplomatic Corps (Tax Enforcement)</h2>
            <p>Members of Britain's diplomatic corps serve as both bailiffs and diplomats in matters of royal revenue and economic enforcement. Tax enforcement is integrated into diplomacy to ensure all diplomatic players learn how Britain's taxation of factions and guilds works.</p>
            
            <h3>Powers of Diplomats in Tax Enforcement</h3>
            <p>Members of the diplomatic corps (High Emissary, Envoys, Diplomats) may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Serve formal notice of tax debt</strong> to guilds, factions, landowners, and other entities</li>
                <li><strong>Record responses:</strong> acknowledgment, payment, refusal, or silence</li>
                <li><strong>Apply Crown liens</strong> to guild or faction stones by Royal Decree</li>
                <li><strong>Initiate seizure proceedings</strong> with guard backing and valid decree</li>
                <li><strong>Oversee lawful collection</strong> when the debtor cooperates voluntarily</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain public records</strong> of all notices, liens, seizures, and outcomes</li>
                <li><strong>Negotiate terms</strong> with debtors on behalf of the Crown (payment plans, partial settlements)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Limits of Diplomatic Tax Enforcement</h3>
            <p>Diplomats may <strong>not</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>❌ Empty faction or guild banks with a single interaction</li>
                <li>❌ Act without a valid Royal Decree authorizing enforcement</li>
                <li>❌ Seize property while all authorized representatives are offline</li>
                <li>❌ Bypass guards—all enforcement requires guard participation</li>
                <li>❌ Override upkeep payments or drain Upkeep Ledgers</li>
                <li>❌ Delete, evict, or destroy factions or guilds unilaterally</li>
                <li>❌ Impose tax rates or create tax policy (that authority belongs to the Crown and Master of Treasury)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Tax Enforcement as Political Intermediary</h3>
            <p>Tax enforcement is not merely collection—it is a political function:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Communicates Crown expectations to debtors</li>
                <li>Delivers warnings and final notices</li>
                <li>Offers opportunities for negotiation before force is applied</li>
                <li>Records refusals and denials of authority (which inform future Crown action)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>A skilled diplomat resolves debt through dialogue. A weak diplomat escalates conflict unnecessarily. A corrupt diplomat becomes a political liability.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Design Philosophy:</strong></p>
                <p>"Tax enforcement is not separate from diplomacy—it is diplomacy backed by economic consequence. By integrating this into the diplomatic corps, every player who joins Diplomacy learns how Britain taxes factions and guilds."</p>

        <!-- Master of the Treasury -->
        <section>
            <h2>Master of the Treasury</h2>
            <p>The Master of the Treasury is the Crown's chief fiscal officer. This role shapes tax policy through proposal, forecasting, and public visibility—but does not execute enforcement.</p>
            
            <h3>Powers of the Master of the Treasury</h3>
            <p>The Master of the Treasury may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Propose tax rate changes</strong> through the Tax Ledger</li>
                <li><strong>Issue fiscal forecasts</strong> and warnings to the Crown</li>
                <li><strong>Provide visibility</strong> into revenue flows, treasury balance, and economic health</li>
                <li><strong>Advise the Crown</strong> on fiscal sustainability and economic risk</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain public ledgers</strong> showing tax rates, revenue, and policy changes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Limits of the Master of the Treasury</h3>
            <p>The Master of the Treasury may <strong>not</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>❌ Collect taxes manually (collection is automatic)</li>
                <li>❌ Grant exemptions or adjust rates unilaterally</li>
                <li>❌ Override Crown decisions on tax policy</li>
                <li>❌ Initiate seizure or enforcement actions</li>
                <li>❌ Apply liens or serve notices (that is the Tax Envoy's role)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Proposal System</h3>
            <p>Tax changes follow a formal process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Master of the Treasury submits a tax proposal to the Tax Ledger</li>
                <li>A 24-hour window begins</li>
                <li>The Crown may approve, reject, or modify the proposal during this window</li>
                <li><strong>If no action is taken within 24 hours, the proposal takes effect automatically</strong></li>
            </ol>
            
            <p><strong>Silence equals consent.</strong> Inaction is recorded as tacit approval. The Crown's responsibility is not limited to explicit decisions—it includes decisions made by default.</p>
            
            <h3>Political Role</h3>
            <p>The Master of the Treasury operates at the intersection of fiscal management and political accountability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Forecasts create public expectations (if the Crown ignores warnings, the Master is vindicated)</li>
                <li>Proposals can be used to force the Crown's hand (making the King choose publicly)</li>
                <li>Failed fiscal policy may result in the Master's resignation (a political weapon)</li>
                <li>The role is blamed when revenue collapses—but also credited when it stabilizes</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Steward -->
        <section>
            <h2>The Steward</h2>
            <p>The Steward assesses property taxes on landowners, guilds, and factions. This role determines <em>how much is owed</em>, but does not collect or enforce.</p>
            
            <h3>Powers of the Steward</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Assess property taxes</strong> on land, buildings, and holdings</li>
                <li><strong>Record assessments</strong> in the public Tax Ledger</li>
                <li><strong>Update assessments</strong> when property changes hands or is improved</li>
                <li><strong>Provide transparency</strong> into how taxes are calculated</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Limits of the Steward</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>❌ Cannot collect taxes (collection is automatic for player trade; property taxes accrue as debt)</li>
                <li>❌ Cannot enforce payment or seize assets</li>
                <li>❌ Cannot issue decrees or serve notices</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The Steward's assessments create the <strong>initial debt record</strong>. From there, the Tax Envoy serves notice, the Crown issues decrees, and guards enforce—or refuse.</p>

        <!-- King / Regent -->
        <section>
            <h2>King / Acting Regent</h2>
            <p>The Crown holds ultimate authority over tax policy and enforcement actions—but this authority is exercised through decree and ratification, not direct action.</p>
            
            <h3>Powers of the Crown</h3>
            <p>The King or Regent may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Approve or reject tax proposals</strong> submitted by the Master of the Treasury</li>
                <li><strong>Override proposals</strong> with alternative policy</li>
                <li><strong>Issue Royal Decrees</strong> authorizing seizure, liens, or enforcement</li>
                <li><strong>Define scope of enforcement</strong> (targets, assets, duration)</li>
                <li><strong>Bear political responsibility</strong> for all economic outcomes</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Limits of the Crown</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>❌ Cannot collect taxes manually (automation prevents favoritism)</li>
                <li>❌ Cannot execute seizure personally (requires Tax Envoy and guards)</li>
                <li>❌ Cannot delete factions or guilds by decree (insolvency does not equal eviction)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Decree System</h3>
            <p>Economic enforcement requires a Royal Decree. The decree must specify:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Target:</strong> Which guild, faction, or entity is subject to enforcement</li>
                <li><strong>Scope:</strong> What assets may be seized (gold, vendors, property)</li>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Time limits on enforcement authority</li>
                <li><strong>Justification:</strong> Legal or political basis (unpaid taxes, defiance, rebellion)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>A decree <strong>permits</strong> action. It does not <strong>guarantee</strong> success. Guards may refuse, targets may resist, and magistrates may intervene.</p>
            
            <h3>Political Responsibility</h3>
            <p>The Crown absorbs all consequences of tax policy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If taxes are too high and merchants flee: Crown is blamed</li>
                <li>If treasury is depleted and salaries fail: Crown is blamed</li>
                <li>If seizure fails due to guard refusal: Crown looks weak</li>
                <li>If enforcement is excessive: Crown loses legitimacy</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This is intentional. The Crown is the ultimate political actor, and economic governance is where legitimacy is tested.</p>

        <!-- Guards -->
        <section>
            <h2>The Guards (Marshal, Captains, Guards)</h2>
            <p>Guards are the enforcement arm of economic policy—but they are <strong>not required to enforce</strong>. This is the system's most critical safeguard.</p>
            
            <h3>Guard Authority in Economic Enforcement</h3>
            <p>When a Royal Decree authorizes seizure, guards may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accompany the Tax Envoy</strong> during enforcement windows</li>
                <li><strong>Secure property</strong> being subjected to seizure</li>
                <li><strong>Confiscate gold</strong> from faction or guild treasuries</li>
                <li><strong>Lock vendors</strong> or restrict access to property</li>
                <li><strong>Record resistance</strong> and use force if targets resist physically</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Guard Refusal</h3>
            <p>Guards may also:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Refuse to enforce</strong> a decree they view as unjust or excessive</li>
                <li><strong>Stall or delay</strong> enforcement to allow negotiation</li>
                <li><strong>Resign in protest</strong> if ordered to execute enforcement they oppose</li>
                <li><strong>Side with the target</strong> if the Crown's authority is contested</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Critical Rule:</strong></p>
                <p>"Guards are permitted, not required, to enforce seizure. If guards decline, seizure fails materially—but this is not a system failure. It is legitimacy being tested."</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
            <p>Guard refusal is not a bug. It is the system's immune response to illegitimate authority. If guards refuse to enforce a decree:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Crown's weakness is exposed</li>
                <li>The Tax Envoy's mission fails</li>
                <li>Political rivals gain ammunition</li>
                <li>The debt remains, but cannot be collected by force</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This forces the Crown to maintain legitimacy. A King who loses the guards has lost the capacity to govern.</p>

        <!-- Magistrate -->
        <section>
            <h2>The Magistrate</h2>
            <p>The Magistrate functions as a legal check on Crown authority. While the Magistrate does not directly shape tax policy, they may intervene in enforcement actions.</p>
            
            <h3>Magistrate Authority</h3>
            <p>The Magistrate may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Review the legal basis</strong> of seizure decrees</li>
                <li><strong>Delay enforcement</strong> to allow judicial review</li>
                <li><strong>Challenge excessive or unlawful seizures</strong> publicly</li>
                <li><strong>Advocate for targets</strong> who dispute Crown claims</li>
                <li><strong>Record findings</strong> that may undermine Crown legitimacy</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Limits of the Magistrate</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>❌ Cannot block enforcement unilaterally (the Crown may override)</li>
                <li>❌ Cannot set tax policy</li>
                <li>❌ Cannot execute seizures</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Political Function</h3>
            <p>The Magistrate provides an alternate voice of authority. If the Magistrate publicly opposes a seizure, it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Legitimizes resistance by the target</li>
                <li>Encourages guards to refuse</li>
                <li>Creates public debate about the Crown's actions</li>
                <li>Provides ammunition for rival claimants</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The Magistrate does not prevent abuse mechanically—they make abuse politically costly.</p>

            <h2>Coordination, Conflict, and Failure</h2>
            <p>Economic enforcement requires multiple actors to cooperate. When coordination succeeds, enforcement proceeds smoothly. When coordination fails, the system reveals deeper political problems.</p>
            
            <h3>Successful Enforcement Requires:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Steward:</strong> Assesses tax and records debt</li>
                <li><strong>Master of Treasury:</strong> Proposes policy that Crown accepts</li>
                <li><strong>Crown:</strong> Issues decree authorizing action</li>
                <li><strong>Diplomatic Corps:</strong> Serves notice and coordinates enforcement</li>
                <li><strong>Guards:</strong> Agree to enforce and provide physical backing</li>
                <li><strong>Magistrate:</strong> Does not challenge the legal basis</li>
                <li><strong>Target:</strong> Complies, or is overcome by force</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>If <strong>any link fails</strong>, enforcement becomes contested:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Guards refuse → Seizure fails materially</li>
                <li>Magistrate challenges → Public legitimacy weakens</li>
                <li>Diplomat negotiates poorly → Targets harden resistance</li>
                <li>Crown issues weak decree → Guards lose confidence</li>
                <li>Master of Treasury resigns → Fiscal chaos follows</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Design Principle:</strong></p>
                <p>"Failure is a feature, not a bug. When economic enforcement breaks down, it reveals where legitimacy has collapsed."</p>

            <h2>Common Scenarios</h2>
            
            <h3>Scenario 1: Routine Tax Increase</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Master of Treasury proposes 2% player trade tax increase</li>
                <li>Crown approves within 24 hours</li>
                <li>Tax Ledger updates automatically</li>
                <li>Revenue flows as expected</li>
                <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> System functions smoothly</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Scenario 2: Excessive Tax Proposal</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Master of Treasury proposes 25% player trade tax (extreme)</li>
                <li>Crown does not respond within 24 hours (proposal auto-accepts)</li>
                <li>Merchants relocate to neighboring cities</li>
                <li>Revenue collapses despite high rates</li>
                <li>Master of Treasury resigns in protest ("I warned you")</li>
                <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Crown absorbs political blame, rival claimants gain support</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Scenario 3: Successful Seizure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Guild owes 50,000 gp in property taxes (Steward assessed, recorded)</li>
                <li>Diplomat serves notice (7-day deadline)</li>
                <li>Guild ignores notice</li>
                <li>Crown issues decree authorizing seizure</li>
                <li>Enforcement window announced publicly (Saturday, 6-8 PM)</li>
                <li>Diplomat + guards arrive at guild hall</li>
                <li>Guild leader is online, complies under duress</li>
                <li>50,000 gp transferred to treasury</li>
                <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Crown authority demonstrated, guild weakened but intact</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Scenario 4: Guard Refusal</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Faction owes 100,000 gp in taxes</li>
                <li>Diplomat serves notice</li>
                <li>Faction refuses payment, claims Crown has no authority over them</li>
                <li>Crown issues decree authorizing seizure</li>
                <li>Guards review decree, conclude it is politically unjust</li>
                <li>Marshal refuses to enforce</li>
                <li>Diplomat cannot proceed (no guard backing)</li>
                <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Seizure fails, Crown looks weak, faction gains leverage, guards demonstrate independent authority</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Scenario 5: Magistrate Intervention</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Crown issues decree to seize merchant guild assets</li>
                <li>Magistrate reviews decree, finds no legal basis (taxes were paid on time)</li>
                <li>Magistrate publicly challenges the decree</li>
                <li>Guards hesitate, awaiting resolution</li>
                <li>Crown either:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>A)</strong> Withdraws decree (admits error, preserves legitimacy)</li>
                        <li><strong>B)</strong> Overrides Magistrate (forces guards to choose sides, risks legitimacy collapse)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Magistrate's challenge creates political cost for Crown overreach</li>
            </ul>
