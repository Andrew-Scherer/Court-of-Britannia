# 💀 Institutional Mortality
**Organizations Are Not Eternal**

---

## 📜 Limbo Is the Enemy
In most UO shards, guilds are "eternal" containers that exist as long as the leader is subscribed. In Britannia, institutions have a heartbeat—and they can die.

### The Rule of Presence
A guild or faction exists only as long as it is **active** and **viable**.
- If a Guild stops paying **Upkeep**, the property decays and the guild dissolves automatically.
- If a leader dies and no [Succession] is established, the assets become contested or unclaimed.

## 📉 Mechanical Decay
Organizations do not "go dormant." They decay.
- **Financial Attrition**: Without active trade and members, the [Upkeep Ledger] eventually runs dry.
- **Institutional Memory**: When the last member of a guild dies, the guild's history remains in the [Public Registries], but its power vanishes instantly.

## 💸 State Seizure (Insolvency)
Tax debts are not abstract numbers; they are **liens against existence**.

- **The Burden**: The Crown can collect a tax debt directly from the Guildstone.
- **The Cascade**: If the stone cannot pay, the debt prevents **Upkeep** payments.
- **The Collapse**: Missed upkeep triggers automatic **Guild Destruction**.
- **The Auction**: Once the guild is detached, the property immediately goes to **Public Auction** (Starting Bid: 1gp).


This is **State Seizure**. A guild that cannot pay the Crown loses the right to exist.

## 🏛️ Legacy Through Absence
The goal of an organization is to survive its founders.
- A guild that persists across 3-4 leader deaths has achieved **Institutional Legitimacy**.
- A guild that collapses when its founder dies was simply a character extension.
