New Player Settlement Justification Document
Why a Curated Onboarding Zone Is Structurally Required
Status: Ship-Ready (v1.0) Scope: Design rationale, system alignment, risk mitigation Explicitly Excludes: NPC scripts, quests, geography, UI flows
1. Executive Summary
This game intentionally breaks several assumptions that modern MMO players bring with them: Global banking Universal markets Risk-free item persistence Crafting-driven progression Without a curated new-player settlement, these breaks will be perceived as bugs, unfairness, or missing features instead of deliberate systems.
The new-player settlement is not a tutorial zone. It is a conceptual re-framing layer that aligns player expectations with the game's actual rules before they encounter full freedom and risk.
2. The Core Problem This Solves
2.1 Player Assumption Mismatch Most players subconsciously assume: Player Assumption This Game's Reality "My bank is global" Storage is local "Markets are everywhere" Markets are geographic "Crafting junk is normal" Practice  production "I can hoard safely" Logistics create risk "Loss is cosmetic"

Loss is economic Dropping players directly into the main world without re-orientation causes confusion, not challenge.
2.2 Confusion Is More Damaging Than Difficulty Players will tolerate: Difficulty Risk Loss Players will not tolerate: Feeling misled Feeling punished for not knowing rules Feeling systems are arbitrary The new-player settlement eliminates ambiguity.
3. What the New-Player Settlement Actually Does
The settlement's purpose is not instruction -- it is normalization. It establishes the following mental models before stakes increase: Goods belong to places Trade is intentional, not automatic Progression does not flood the world with items Britain is aspirational, not default Loss exists, but is contextual and fair Once these are internalized, the full game becomes legible.
4. System Alignment (Why This Supports Everything Else)
4.1 Market Economy Without onboarding: Players expect global markets Fragmentation feels broken With onboarding: Local markets feel intentional Scarcity feels meaningful Britain feels earned
4.2 Banking & Logistics

Without onboarding: Local banks feel like missing features Britain feels artificially restricted With onboarding: Storage geography feels natural Movement becomes gameplay, not friction
4.3 Crafting Overhaul Without onboarding: Players look for grind recipes No-item practice feels pointless With onboarding: Learning vs production is understood Oversupply prevention is invisible and accepted
4.4 Permadeath & Risk Systems Without onboarding: Death feels punitive and arbitrary With onboarding: Loss is contextualized Risk escalation feels earned
5. Why This Cannot Be Replaced by Tooltips or Tutorials
Tooltips explain how. This settlement teaches why. The systems in this game are: Interdependent Emergent Systemic They cannot be understood in isolation or via UI hints. The settlement allows players to: Observe systems in low-stakes conditions Infer rules naturally Build correct mental models This produces confidence, not compliance.

6. Economic Protection Function
The new-player settlement also protects the live economy: Prevents early-game junk flooding Prevents market misunderstanding Prevents new-player hoarding mistakes Prevents Britain congestion Filters players who expect convenience-MMO patterns This improves long-term economic health.
7. Retention Impact (Honest Assessment)
This design will: Reduce short-term conversion Increase mid- and long-term retention Strongly select for the target audience This is a feature, not a drawback.
Players who leave here would leave later -- after causing economic or social friction.
8. What Breaks If You Skip This
If players start directly in the main world: Banking feels hostile Markets feel incomplete Crafting feels unintuitive Loss feels unfair Britain feels artificially gated The economy feels opaque At that point, no amount of balance fixes perception.
9. Design North Star
If you need a single internal justification:
"This game requires new assumptions. Those assumptions must be taught by environment, not UI."
10. Final Conclusion

A curated new-player settlement is structurally required because: The game intentionally violates genre norms Systems only make sense when seen together Player perception determines system success Economics depend on correct early behavior Confusion is a greater threat than difficulty This settlement is not content -- it is infrastructure.
Final Verdict
 Required  Justified  Low scope compared to impact  Protects every major system  Improves economic and social stability Skipping it would undermine the entire design.
