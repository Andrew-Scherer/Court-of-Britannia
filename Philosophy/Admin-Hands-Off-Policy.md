**The World Is Player-Owned (Including the Failures)**

## 🏛️ Staff as Engineers, Not Parents
The staff of Kingdoms of Britannia function as system engineers and environment janitors. They do not function as the "Parents" of the simulation.

### The Intervention Boundary
**Staff will NOT intervene in:**
- **Political Disputes**: If a King is a tyrant, use the [Justice System] or [Bounty System].
- **Economic Warfare**: If a guild is being squeezed by taxes or liens, use [Diplomacy].
- **In-Game Losses**: Staff will not "undo" accidental deaths, misplaced items, or bad trades.
- **Office Vacancies**: If no player is filling a role, the system persists in a state of neglect. Staff do not "fill in" for players.

---

## 📜 The "Undo" Prohibition
In a permadeath environment, **History is Linear**.
- There are no "rollbacks" for character deaths.
- There are no "prizes" returned if they are stolen or lost.
- **Why?** If a GM can undo a loss, the weight of every other action in the shard is halved.

---

## 🛠️ When Staff DO Intervene
Staff intervention is strictly limited to:
- **Technical Failure**: Server crashes, corrupted data, or verified mechanical bugs.
- **OOC Harassment**: Violations of the Community Code of Conduct.
- **Metagaming/Cheating**: Actions that bypass the simulation's rules (e.g., speedhacks, multi-boxing).

---

## ⚖️ Legitimacy Is Your Only Shield
Staff will not protect you from players. 
- If you find yourself in a losing position, you must bribe, negotiate, fight, or flee.
- **Appeal to the Court, not the Discord.**

> *The world is brutal by design. The staff will not rob you of your tragedy.*
