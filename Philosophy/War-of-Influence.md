# 🍷 War of Influence
**Weaponizing the State Against Rivals**

---

## 📜 Diplomacy is Warfare
In a permadeath environment, raw violence is high-risk. The smartest players do not just use swords; they use **The State**.
Influence is the art of pointing the Crown's guns at your enemies.

## 1. Weaponizing Legitimacy (Attacking Recognition)
Allegiance is Self-Declared, but **Recognition** is granted by the Crown. You cannot stop a rival from claiming they are loyal, but you can force the Crown to call them a liar.

*   **The Goal**: Force the Crown to **Revoke Recognition** (Outlawry).
*   **The Method (Sedition)**: A rival claims to be a Vassal. You prove they are a Fraud.
    *   **Harboring**: Show they are housing Red Criminals.
    *   **Insolvency**: Show they are failing to pay the taxes they promised.
    *   **Treason**: Show they are plotting against the Crown.
*   **The Result**: The Crown declares them **Outlawed**.
    *   They still claim Allegiance (Self-Declared).
    *   But the Crown validates **Violence** against them.

## 2. Weaponizing Debt (State Seizure)
You can destroy a guild without ever fighting them by attacking their **Solvency**.
*   **The Mechanism**: The [Institutional Mortality](Institutional-Mortality.md) rule (Tax Debt = Liquidation).
*   **The Trap**:
    1.  Force a rival into a costly war (drain their coffers).
    2.  Petition the Master of Treasury to audit their tax payments.
    3.  If they miss a payment, the Crown seizes the Guildstone.
    4.  **Result**: Instant Guild Destruction. Their property goes to public auction for 1gp.

## 3. Weaponizing The Crowd (Legitimacy)
Kings need Vassals to survive. If a King refuses to protect his Vassals, he loses **Legitimacy**.
*   **The Pressure**: Publicly document every time the King fails to punish a criminal or protect a trade route.
*   **The Result**: A King viewed as weak loses tax revenue (players renounce Allegiance).
*   **The Coup**: A delegitimized King is easy to overthrow.

## ⚖️ The Goal: Erasure
The ultimate victory is not killing a player.
It is erasing their institution from the map using the King's own hand.
