# 🍷 War of Influence
**Political Strategy & Non-Violent Conflict**

---

## 📜 Diplomacy is War by Other Means
In a permadeath environment, raw violence is the highest-risk option. To survive, players must learn to "attack" their rivals using the shard's systems without ever drawing a blade.

### 1. Attacking the Legitimacy Bar
You don't need to kill a King to remove him. You can make his rule **Illegitimate**.
- **Public Record**: Use the [Arrest Records] or [Mortuary Rolls] to highlight patterns of abuse.
- **The Seat System**: Engineer a political vacuum so that the King's appointees (Marshal, Commissioner) are fired for inaction.

### 2. Economic Strangulation (Bureaucracy as a Weapon)
You do not need to be in the Royal Court to use the Crown's tools; you simply need to compel the Crown to act.
- **Influencing Liens**: Non-court players can pressure the Crown to apply [Crown Liens] to rivals through:
    - **Applying Pressure (Lobbying)**: While not a hard-coded system, transferring gold to the Master of Treasury or Royal Appointees is a powerful incentive for them to prioritize **enforcement**. You are paying for the King to dispatch Guards and Diplomats to collect a rival's debt.
    - **Presenting Evidence**: Provide the [Public Registries] or [Justice Records] showing a rival guild is harboring known criminals or in debt to the city. See [Justice-System#Harboring-Revocation].
    - **Lesser Outlawry**: Under the [Britain-Sole-Civic] model, a guild harboring criminals can be declared **Outlawed**, justifying the physical seizure of their assets by the Crown.
    - **Public Petitioning**: Publicly petition the King to enforce "Economic Stability." If the Crown refuses to act against a disruptive and documented threat, they lose legitimacy in the eyes of the public.

### 3. Legal Maneuvering
The [Justice System] allows for "Licensed Execution."
- **Bounty Seeding**: Don't fight a rival guild; fund their bounties. Force the world's [Headhunters] to do the risk-intensive work for you.
- **Forensic Weaponization**: Bring a [Forensic Investigator] to **every crime scene**. Ensure that every "accidental" death is recorded as a Murder in the [Mortuary Rolls].

## ⚖️ The Goal: Surrender, Not Erasure
The most successful political players use violence only to **finish** a conflict that has already been won through words, gold, and registries.
