# ⚖️ Britain as the Sole Civic System

**The Imperial Monopoly on Legitimacy**

---

> *Britain is the only place where law exists.*
> *The rest of the world is just property waiting to be seized.*
> *Gold determines survival. Allegiance determines right.*

---

## Core Thesis

**Britain is the only *Opt-In* civic institution in the world.**

The world is divided into **The Empire (Britain)** and **The Wilderness**.
- **The Empire:** Requires a contract of **Allegiance**. Grants protection, justice, and trade access.
- **The Wilderness:** A target-rich environment. No laws, no protection, only prey.

Everything else—cities, ruins, forts, covenants—is territorial, not civic. Those places are controlled by **guilds**, not governments.

> **📜 Important Terminology**
>
> **"Vassal" / "Citizen"**: An entity that has sworn **Allegiance** to the Crown.
> **"Target" / "Wilderness"**: An entity that has refused the contract.

There is no "Network of City-States."
There is the **Crown**, and there are those who kneel.

## Britain's Role: The Active Hegemon

Britain is not a service provider; it is an **Empire**.
It offers Law only to those who pay for it.

**It remains the sole source of:**

- **Allegiance** (The only form of Citizenship)
- Courts and High Justice
- Civic Taxation (The cost of Civilization)
- Salaried Offices & Titles
- Official Warrants & Decrees

**Britain never deactivates.**
**Britain cannot collapse mechanically.**

> Britain is powerful because it **monopolizes** the tools of civilization (Banking, Clearinghouse, Justice).
> You can live without the Crown, but you will live in the dirt.

---

## The World Beyond Britain

Outside of the contract, there are **no cities** in the civic sense.

**There are only:**

- **Guild-controlled territories** (Warlord Fiefdoms)
- **Economic Strongholds** (maintained via Void Upkeep)
- **Warzones** (everywhere else)

> **Territorial Control Logic**
>
> **A place exists politically only if a guild can afford to hold it.**
>
> **If Allegiance is Sworn:** The Guild pays Tax to Britain.
> **If Non-Aligned:** The Guild pays Upkeep to the Void.
>
> **There is no population requirement.**
> **Only economic viability.**

---

## Guilds as Territorial Powers

Guilds (and their emergent alliances) are the primary actors of the world.

**They:**

- Control land
- Maintain structures
- Enforce their own internal rules
- Rise and fall based on gold flow

**Guild authority is real, but it is not Legal.**

A guild can dominate a continent, but without Crown Recognition, they are just **Squatters with Swords**.

---

## Recognition: The Crown's Weapon

Britain does not rule guilds directly.
Britain **Recognizes** them—or targets them.

**Recognition is Britain's primary outward-facing weapon.**

### Recognition States

A guild exists in one of three states relative to the Crown:

#### 1. Recognized (The Vassal)

Britain treats the faction as a legitimate authority.

- Trade is lawful.
- Warrants are honored.
- Fealty and taxation apply.
- **Violence against them is constained:** Attacks on Recognized entities may trigger political consequences.

#### 2. Tolerated (The Grey Zone)

Britain ignores their existence.

- No tribute.
- No protection.
- **Status:** You are on your own. Violence against you is effectively ignored by the state.

#### 3. Outlawed (The Enemy)

Britain declares the faction to be an enemy of the state.

- Warrants are invalid.
- Trade is sanctioned/blocked.
- **Status:** **Kill on Sight.** Violence against them is not just justified; it is encouraged.

---

## Allegiance — Britain Only

**Allegiance** is the only legal standing that matters.

**Allegiance mechanics:**

- **Allegiance = Citizenship.**
- **Exile = Loss of Standing.**
- **Allegiance ends on Permadeath.**

There is no allegiance system for guilds or territories beyond Britain. You are either a Subject of the Crown, or you are a Foreign Combatant.

## Law vs Territory

This distinction is absolute:

| Concept | Britain | The World |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Law** | ✅ Exists | ❌ None |
| **Courts** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Allegiance** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Legal Standing** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Territory Control** | ❌ None | ✅ Absolute |
| **Upkeep-Based Power** | ❌ None | ✅ Absolute |

> Britain governs **Subjects** (who swear Allegiance).
> Guilds govern **Dirt** (which requires Upkeep).

---

## Violence & Legitimacy

Britain does not prevent violence.
**Britain defines whether violence is Justified.**

The State uses violence as a tool to enforce hierarchy.

- **Killing a Recognized Leader:** An act of **War** (Political Consequence).
- **Killing an Outlawed Leader:** An act of **Enforcement** (Legal Consequence).
- **Attacking Tolerated Guilds:** Politically **Ambiguous** (No State Protection).

The system does not judge morality.
**Players do.**

## Rebellion is War

Britain **does** fight rebels.

**Rebellion is not just a status; it is a declaration of Total War.**

**The Crown Responds:**
- **Loyalist Mandate:** Vassal guilds are expected to crush rebellions to prove their loyalty.
- **State Violence:** The Crown authorizes **Total War** against rebel holdings.
- **No Neutrality:** You are either with the Crown or you are a target.

**Outlawed guilds:**
- Are energetic enemies of the state
- Face active military suppression
- Violence against them is **Required**, not just justified

> **However:**
>
> It is quite possible that a rebellious guild, if they grow strong enough, can **take control of Britain through brute strength**.
>
> If the King dies and a rebel guild takes control of the coronation ceremony, a surviving member of their guild can **crown themselves King**.

### Historical Context: William the Conqueror (1066)

1. William invades England (technically illegal).
2. He wins one decisive battle.
3. He gets crowned King.

**After the coronation:**

- All remaining English resistance is declared **Outlawry**.
- Those still fighting are not "defenders"—they are **Criminals**.

**Legitimacy is just the ability to win the final battle.**

---

## Design Canon

**These rules are absolute:**

1.  **Britain is the only Civic Authority.**
2.  **Guilds are the only Territorial Powers.**
3.  **Gold determines Survival.**
4.  **Allegiance determines Rights.**
5.  **Violence is the only true enforcement.**

There is no "Empire Building" mechanic.
There is only **Submission** or **War**.
