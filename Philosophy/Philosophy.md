# 📜 Server Philosophy

**The Foundational Principles**

---

## Core Design Philosophy

This is not an MMO with RPG elements bolted on. This is a **feudal tragedy simulator** built on Ultima Online's mechanics, where every decision has weight, every relationship matters, and every death reshapes the political landscape.

> *You don't start with a world. You start with a court.*

Courts are volatile by design — kings die, regimes fall, offices turn over. What allows the world to persist through this constant churn are the organizations players build: the guilds that survive their founders, the factions that hold territory through successive leaders. Courts create decisions. Organizations create continuity.

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Death Is Permanent

When a character dies, they are gone forever. No respawns. No alts holding power simultaneously. This single rule transforms every other system:

- Every fight risks erasure
- Every alliance has weight
- Reputation outlives the character
- Cowards survive; legends die early

But death is not only personal erasure. It tests succession, loyalty, economic upkeep, and institutional resilience. A guild that survives its founder's death proves legitimacy. A faction that collapses when its leader dies was never an organization — it was a personality cult. Death reveals what was real.

#### Permadeath Creates Interdependence

In most games, death is an inconvenience. Here, it's permanent—and that permanence transforms solo play into **necessary collaboration**.

- **Assassins matter** because when they kill a king, he's gone
- **Guards matter** because they're the only thing standing between the weak and erasure
- **Bounty hunters matter** because bringing a murderer to justice actually makes the realm safer
- **Murderers matter** because they're taking real lives, creating real grievances, demanding real justice

You can't farm solo for loot and ignore the world. You can't avoid politics and stay safe. You **must** organize, ally, and defend together—or you won't survive.

> **The goal isn't just to create great stories. It's to create them together, because the alternative is dying alone.**

### 2. Power Is Political

Strength alone does not grant authority. Power must be:

- **Recognized** — by those who witness it
- **Justified** — by theory or precedent
- **Defended** — against constant challenge

The strongest fighter can still lose everything if legitimacy crumbles.

Power can now be collective as well as individual. Organizations amplify claims but do not grant authority automatically — they compete inside legitimacy, not above it. The question shifts from "Can I win this fight?" to "Who stands behind me if I lose?"

### 3. Legitimacy Is Everything

Legitimacy answers the question: "Why should anyone accept your rule even when they don't like you?"

In this shard, legitimacy is **determined not by mechanics, but by who recognizes the outcome.** Kings die, regents seize temporary authority, heirs claim official succession, and claimants challenge from outside the system. There is no single "right answer" — only claims that survive and claims that fail.

This is medieval court drama: bloody, contested, and full of story. Power is won through political maneuvering, violence, and securing support. Legitimacy can be inherited, seized, granted, or simply recognized when no one dares to challenge it.

> **The real goal:** Give players the opportunity to be part of a great story, even if they don't live to see the end of it.

### 4. Civilization Is A Choice
**The most radical philosophy on this shard is that Civilization is Opt-In.**
You are not born a citizen. You are born in the Wilderness. To be civilized—to use the bank, to be protected by guards, to have murder count as a crime—you must **sign the contract**.

*   **The Cost:** Taxes and obedience.
*   **The Benefit:** Order and access.
*   **The Alternative:** Absolute freedom in the dark.

This makes "Law" a value proposition, not a default state. If the King taxes too much, people will choose the Wilderness.

## What Players Actually Do

Players don't log in to grind, wait for quests, or look for content. They log in to:

### React to Situations Already in Motion

- A decree was issued yesterday
- Someone was arrested overnight
- A rumor spread while they were offline
- A role became vacant due to death
- An organization collapsed, splintered, or seized new territory

### Pursue Pressure, Not Tasks

- Who needs something from me?
- Who is blocking me?
- Who benefits if I act?
- Who benefits if I don't?

### Provoke Reactions

- Public accusations
- Private bargains
- Challenges to legitimacy
- Requests for sanctuary
- Demands for trials

> *Players stop asking "What can I do?" and start asking "What position am I in right now?"*

## Design Principles

### Roles Create Pressure, Not Chores

Every player role should either:

- Force a decision
- Delay a decision
- Reframe a decision
- Make a decision dangerous

If a role doesn't do one of those — it should be cut or automated via NPC.

### Systems Run Without Babysitting

If the world must continue functioning when a player is offline or dead, that responsibility belongs to an NPC or system — not a role. Roles should create drama, not chores.

Even organizations are mortal. Collapse, decay, and loss happen automatically. No limbo states, no admin cleanup, no mercy — only consequences.

### Inaction Has Consequences

Silence creates pressure through social and political consequences. If players can avoid risk by doing nothing, intrigue dies. Inaction results in:

- Removal from roles (the King fires an absent Marshal)
- Loss of property (eviction for neglected duties)
- Political vulnerability (rivals exploit the vacuum)
- Public record of absence

These are player-driven consequences, not mechanical penalties.

### Bold Failure Is Rewarded

Players must know: *Dying spectacularly is better than surviving quietly.*

- Chronicle emphasis on impact, not longevity
- Prestige for martyrs, disgraced figures, fallen leaders
- Public recognition of "the act that changed things"

> **Warning:** If dying feels like "I failed the shard," players will burn out. If dying feels like "I finished a chapter," they come back energized.

## Britain-Only Season 1

The shard deliberately starts small. All player characters start in Britain. All pre-constructed roles are British roles. Other cities exist but are distant and politically reactive, not active.

This is intentional:

- **Density creates drama** — everyone shares taverns, streets, courts
- **Deaths are witnessed** — rumors spread fast
- **Reputations form quickly** — no hiding in empty zones
- **Small population feels intense** — not "the server is empty" but "this court is tense"

> *The world is large. But power is decided in Britain.*

Britain is a crucible for institutions, not just characters. Early guilds and factions define political culture. Their successes — and their collapses — teach the shard how power actually works here. Institutional failure is not a bug. It is part of the drama.

## Protecting the Fun

The shard maintains fun through:

- Roles that invite action
- Permadeath to give weight
- NPC systems to prevent stalls
- A small, dense starting population
- No busywork roles
- Clear social permission to fail

The only thing that must be actively cultivated: **Players being brave enough to act.**
