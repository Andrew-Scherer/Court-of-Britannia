# 🏨 Inn Storage (The Starter Bank)

**A Temporary Safety Net for New Arrivals**

---

## Concept
When you first arrive in Britannia, you have no house, no guild, and no settlement ties. The **Inn Storage** system gives new players a **free, temporary bank** to store their first earnings while they learn the world.

> *It's a grace period, not a service.*

## Mechanics

### 1. Eligibility
*   **New Characters Only**: Available for the first **3 days** of character creation.
*   **Account Timer**: The 3-day window starts when the character is created, not when they first use it.
*   **One-Time Use**: Once expired, it cannot be renewed, even on new characters (account-wide tracking).

### 2. Capacity
*   **Weight Limit**: 100 stones (enough to store starter gear and early loot).

### 3. Access
*   **Free**: No cost to deposit or withdraw.
*   **Available Everywhere**: Accessible from any Inn in any city (global access during the 3-day window).

### 4. Expiration (The Hard Cutoff)
*   **3-Day Deadline**: At exactly 72 hours after character creation, the storage is **wiped clean**.
*   **No Warnings**: The system does not send reminders. The timer is visible on the storage interface.
*   **Instant Deletion**: All items are permanently destroyed, no "Lost & Found".

## Purpose & Anti-Exploit

### New Player Onboarding
This gives new players breathing room to:
*   Store their first dungeon loot safely.
*   Learn the banking system without risk.
*   Experiment with crafting without losing materials.

### Anti-Alt Abuse
*   **Account-Wide Tracking**: You cannot create infinite alts to get infinite free storage.
*   **Hard Expiration**: Veterans cannot use this as a long-term storage exploit.
*   **No Extensions**: There is no way to reset or extend the timer.

## Role in Britain
For new players spawning in the Capital, this solves the "Where do I put my stuff?" problem during the critical first 3 days. After that, they must either:
*   **Buy property** in Britain (expensive, privileged access to Trade Docks).
*   **Travel to a nearby settlement** (Paws, Yew) to use a Settlement Bank.
*   **Join a guild** and use their vault.
