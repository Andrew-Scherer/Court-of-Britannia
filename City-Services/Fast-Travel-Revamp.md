Fast Travel Revamp
Perfect -- this is exactly the right instinct. At this stage you want principles, not parameters. If the principles are right, the numbers can come later. Below is a core-ideas document for player travel that you can use as a north-star for all later implementation, UI, and tuning. No mechanics bloat, no edge-case handling -- just the rules that everything else must obey.
Player Travel -- Core Design Principles
Distance, Intent, and Consequence
1. Why Travel Matters in This Game
In this game, travel is not just movement. Travel determines: Where goods live Where markets function Where power concentrates Where risk exists How the economy breathes If travel is trivial, geography collapses and the rest of the systems lose meaning.
2. The Three Things That Can Move (This Is the Foundation)
All movement in the game falls into exactly three categories: Intent (orders, contracts, promises) Players (characters) Goods (items, materials, equipment) Each category follows different rules.
3. The Non-Negotiable Rule
Intent may move freely.

Players may move conditionally. Goods may never teleport. This single rule preserves: Logistics Settlement identity Trade routes Smuggling Risk vs reward Every travel feature must obey it.
4. Goods Are Anchored to Place
Goods: Exist in the world Are stored in settlement banks Must be carried, shipped, or escorted Cannot be summoned, recalled, or teleported This makes: Trade a physical act Storage a strategic choice Distance economically meaningful If goods teleport, the economy collapses.
5. Britain Already Has "Fast Travel" -- For Intent
Britain's clearing system allows: Orders to appear everywhere Gold to wait centrally Trade to persist without player presence This is intent fast travel, and it is good.
It reduces busywork without reducing consequence.
6. Player Movement Exists to Serve Play, Not Commerce
Player travel exists to: Reduce boredom Enable social play Allow exploration

It must never: Move goods for free Replace delivery gameplay Eliminate risk Flatten geography Convenience is allowed. Economic bypass is not.
7. Distance Must Always Have a Cost
That cost may be: Time Risk Money Scarcity Opportunity But it must exist. If distance becomes free: Settlements become skins Markets become menus Travel becomes cosmetic
8. Asymmetry Is a Feature
Travel does not need to be: Fair Symmetric Uniform In fact, it should not be. Examples of healthy asymmetry: Easy to reach Britain, harder to leave with goods Safer routes that are longer Faster routes that are dangerous Outlaws having fewer options Asymmetry creates strategy.
9. Travel Should Create Roles
When travel matters:

Haulers matter Escorts matter Scouts matter Smugglers matter If travel is trivial, these roles disappear.
10. Travel Must Reinforce the World Hierarchy
Travel should naturally teach players that: Britain is for coordination and clearing Settlements are for storage and fulfillment Wilderness is for risk and reward No UI explanation should be required.
11. What Travel Is Not Allowed to Do
Travel may not: Bypass storage geography Replace market mechanics Turn logistics into a click Eliminate danger Make Britain a warehouse If a travel feature does any of these, it violates the design.
12. The Litmus Test (Use This Constantly)
When evaluating a travel idea, ask:
"Does this move value without effort?" If the answer is yes, it's not allowed.
13. Final Design North Star
Travel should make the world feel large, not inconvenient. And it should make trade feel deliberate, not tedious.
Final Takeaway
You don't need to decide:

speeds mounts routes cooldowns portals yet. You only need these truths locked in: Goods are physical Intent is abstract Players sit in between Distance matters With that foundation, every later decision becomes obvious instead of debated. This is exactly the right place to pause before getting granular.
