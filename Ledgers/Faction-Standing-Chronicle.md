# 📜 Register of Standing & Interfaction Chronicle

**Who Counts Today — Who Can Be Trusted Tomorrow**

---

*Two ledgers. Two purposes. Never merged.*


## Register of Standing


### What It Shows (ONLY Current State)


- **Recognized factions**
- **Tolerated factions**
- **Outlawed factions**
- **Current fealty relationships**
- **Current protectorate assignments (if any)**


### What It Explicitly Does NOT Show


- ❌ Past recognition
- ❌ Old fealty
- ❌ Who betrayed whom last year
- ❌ Why something changed

**No history. No narrative. No explanation.**

*Just status.*


### Why This Must Exist Separately


- Players need instant clarity
- Guards need to know who's lawful
- Merchants need to know who's safe
- Violence needs political framing now


## Interfaction Chronicle


### What It Records


- Faction fealty sworn / broken (with dates)
- Tribute compliance over time
- Recognition changes (granted, revoked)
- Interventions
- Withdrawals of protection
- Public justifications
- Official accusations


### What It Never Does


- ❌ Declare current legality
- ❌ Override the Register of Standing
- ❌ Simplify history


### Why This Must Remain Separate


- Reputation needs duration
- Betrayal needs memory
- Patterns matter
- "This was a mistake" becomes provable

**This is where:**


- Factions plan long-term
- Diplomats argue precedent
- Rebels justify action
- Loyalists point to receipts


*History is ammunition
            and this is the armory.*



## How They Work Together (Critical)


> **❗ Note**


## Why Merging Them Would Be a Mistake

If you merge them:


- The present gets muddy
- History becomes cluttered
- New players get lost
- Legitimacy becomes arguable instead of visible


## Final Canon Lock-In


## Comparison Table


| Feature | Register of Standing | Interfaction Chronicle |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Current snapshot | Historical record |
| Question | "How does Britain treat you now?" | "How did we get here?" |
| Updates | Overwrites previous state | Append-only, permanent |
| Shows | Recognized, Tolerated, Outlawed status | Dates, events, changes over time |
| Does NOT Show | Why, when, or history | Current legal status |
| Used By | Guards, merchants, fighters (immediate) | Diplomats, planners, historians (long-term) |
| Character | Binary, cold, cruel | Slow, contextual, damning |
| Effect | Instant clarity | Long-term consequence |


## Summary

The **Register of Standing** is Britain's current, authoritative declaration of how factions are treated — recognized, tolerated, or outlawed. It provides no history, no justification, only status. Players, guards, and merchants check it for immediate clarity.

The **Interfaction Chronicle** is a permanent historical record of fealty changes, tribute compliance, recognition grants and revocations, and official justifications. It provides context, patterns, and precedent, but never declares current legality.

They must cross-reference but never merge. One tells you who counts today. The other tells you who can be trusted tomorrow.
