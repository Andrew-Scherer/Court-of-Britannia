# 📋 The Registry of Estates and Holdings

**A Comprehensive Record of Land and Property Across Britain**

> Land changes hands through authority, through commerce, and through loss. The Registry records all three.
> A noble family may hold an estate for generations, entered into the Registry by royal grant. When the family falls from favor, the eviction is recorded. When the estate is auctioned, the auction is recorded. When the merchant who purchased it dies and leaves no heir, the abandonment is recorded. When the property is claimed again, that claim is recorded.
> Each transition is preserved. Each holder is named. The Registry does not mourn those who lose property, nor celebrate those who gain it. It simply notes the passage. And in doing so, it ensures that the history of land—its movement, its contested ownership, its centrality to the realm's stability—is never forgotten, even when those who held it are.
