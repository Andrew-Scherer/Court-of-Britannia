# 🏰 The Royal Land Ledger

**A Register of Crown Properties and the Authority Used Upon Them**

---


> **❗ Note**
> **On the Preservation of Power**
>
> The Royal Land Ledger does not exist to protect the innocent or to restrain the tyrant. It exists because the Crown—whoever holds it—requires an accounting of what has been done with the realm's most valuable properties.
> Even a usurper benefits from the Ledger, for it allows him to see whom his predecessor rewarded and whom he dispossessed. Even a Regent who governs without formal sanction keeps the Ledger current, for it lends the *appearance* of order to actions that may later be contested.
> The Ledger is not moral. It is institutional. And institutions, unlike men, do not forget. They preserve what was done, so that those who come after may decide what it meant.
