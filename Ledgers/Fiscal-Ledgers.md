**Revenue, Reality, and Economic Identity**

## 📜 The Tax Ledger (Policy)
The **Tax Ledger** is the administrative record of the realm's fiscal policy. It is managed by the [Master of the Treasury] and serves as the public log for all rate changes.

### Granular Data Tracked:
- **Tax Category**:
    - **Player Trade**: Sales tax on vendors/shops.
    - **Property Transfer**: One-time tax on real estate sales.
    - **Civic Residency Tax**: Recurring tax on Britain-based property.
    - **Storage Fees**: Daily fees for long-term dock storage.
    - **Fealty Tributes**: Fixed intervals of gold from recognized guilds.
- **Current Rate**: The active percentage or flat fee effective for all transactions.
- **Proposed Rate**: A pending change submitted by the Master of the Treasury.
- **Ratification Window**: A 24-hour countdown for the Crown to approve or veto.
- **Author Identity**: The specific official who submitted the change.
- **Policy History**: A permanent log of every rate change since the Shard's inception.

> **Political Impact**: Citizens use this ledger to identify when the Crown is "squeezing" the economy. Silence for 24 hours is recorded as **Administrative Consent**, pinning the blame for tax hikes on the Monarch.

## 🏛️ The Treasury Ledger (Inflow & Outflow)
The **Treasury Ledger** tracks the physical health of the Britain Treasury. It does not set policy; it records the **outcomes** of policy.

### Intake Tracking (Revenue):
- **Trade Inflow**: Aggregated gold from the Player Trade tax.
- **Real Estate Inflow**:
    - **Transfer Inflow**: 50% of Property Transfer Taxes.
    - **Residency Inflow**: 100% of Britain Civic recurring property taxes.
- **Logistics Inflow**: The "Crown Share" (25%) of successful export refunds.
- **Storage Inflow**: Accumulated fees from overdue dock storage.
- **Tribute Inflow**: Direct transfers from Guild Treasuries via fealty compacts.

### The "Void" Record (Sinks):
While the Treasury tracks revenue, the ledger also logs **Gold Sinks** to verify economic stability:
- **Voided Property Tax**: The other 50% of the Property Transfer tax.
- **Wilderness Upkeep**: 100% of gold spent on maintaining territory outside Britain.

### Outtake Tracking (Expenditure):
- **Indexed Salaries**: Daily gold distributed to all active [Civic Seats] (Marshal, Stewards, etc.).

- **Lien Intercepts**: Gold successfully diverted from debtor guild stones into the Treasury.

> **Political Impact**: If the "Outtake" exceeds the "Intake," the ledger generates a **Fiscal Alert**. If the balance hits zero, role salaries are automatically suspended, leading to immediate administrative collapse and likely political unrest.

## 🧾 The Salary Ledger (Staffing)
An institutional log of every salaried position in the Britain government.

### Granular Data Tracked:

- **Daily Rate**: The amount of gold the seat extracts from the Treasury every 24 hours.
- **Arrears Balance**: Gold owed to the player if the Treasury was too low to pay a full salary.
- **Payment Log**: A timestamped record of every gold transfer to the player's bank account.
