# 📖 Public Death Ledger

**The Realm's Authoritative Record of Death**

---


## What the Public Death Ledger Is

The Public Death Ledger is the realm's authoritative record of death. Every character death automatically creates an entry in this ledger. These entries exist independently of witness testimony, official investigation, or political acknowledgment. The ledger records death as fact before it becomes story, accusation, or crime.

The ledger is not an investigative tool. It is not a permission system. It is not controlled by any single role or authority. It is the realm's memory of who died, when, and what was learned about their death. It ensures that no death disappears, no death requires permission to exist, and no single authority controls whether a death is remembered.

The ledger operates in three layers:


- **Automatic baseline record** — Generated when death occurs, containing no interpretation
- **Forensic update** — Added when someone with Forensic Evaluation examines a corpse, providing detailed death information based on skill level
- **Investigator addendum** — Optionally authored by investigators, containing investigation findings, testimony, and judgment

Each layer adds depth without erasing what came before. The baseline entry persists whether or not examination or investigation ever occurs. This ensures the ledger functions as institutional memory rather than political filter.


## Why the Ledger Exists

The Public Death Ledger exists to prevent selective amnesia. Without it, deaths that politically inconvenience those in power simply vanish. Guards kill prisoners "during questioning" and no record exists. Nobles assassinate rivals and no one remembers. Executions occur without trial and no documentation remains.

The ledger does not prevent these acts — it ensures they cannot be unmade. A regime may choose not to investigate a death, but it cannot choose to erase the fact that death occurred. This creates accountability through visibility rather than prohibition. What the realm does with that visibility is political, not mechanical.

The ledger also provides continuity across regime changes. When a new King takes the throne, the ledger documents what the previous regime did. Patterns of custody deaths, executions without trial, or suspicious violence remain visible. New authorities inherit both the power and the record of how that power was previously used.


## Automatic Death Recording (Baseline Truth)

When a character dies, the Public Death Ledger automatically generates a baseline entry. This occurs regardless of location, circumstance, witnesses, or political context. No role must activate this process. No official must authorize it. Death itself creates the record.

The baseline entry contains:


- **Name of the deceased**
- **Time of death**
- **Location of death**
- **Status: Unexamined**

This entry is factual and non-interpretive. It makes no claim about how the death occurred, who was responsible, or whether the death was lawful. It records only that a named individual ceased to exist at a specific time and place.

The baseline entry exists before anyone witnesses the death, before any Coroner examines the body, before any Magistrate rules on legality. It is the realm's acknowledgment that something happened. Everything else — investigation, judgment, consequence — builds from this foundation.


### No Death Requires Permission to Exist

The automatic nature of baseline recording ensures that no authority can prevent a death from being recorded. A King cannot order the ledger to ignore an execution. A Guard cannot suppress evidence of a custody death. A Coroner cannot refuse to allow a death to appear in the record.

This does not mean deaths receive equal attention. It means they receive equal existence. What happens after the baseline entry is created — whether investigation occurs, whether witnesses are heard, whether political consequence follows — remains subject to discretion, resources, and politics.


## Ledger Entry States

Ledger entries progress through states that reflect information depth rather than resolution or judgment. These states indicate what is known about a death, not whether the death was justified, criminal, or politically significant.


| State | Meaning | What Changed |
|---|---|---|
| Unexamined | A death occurred; no further information exists | Baseline entry created automatically on death |
| Examined | Someone with Forensic Evaluation has examined the body | Forensic indicators added based on examiner's skill level |
| Annotated | Additional commentary has been added | Investigator addendum published (investigation findings, witness testimony, judgment) |

These states do not expire or reset. Once a death is examined, it remains examined. Once annotated, it remains annotated. This ensures the ledger accumulates information over time rather than reflecting only the current moment.


### State Transitions Are Non-Linear

A death may be annotated without being examined if an investigator adds commentary based on witness testimony without performing forensic evaluation. A death may remain unexamined indefinitely if no one with Forensic Evaluation chooses to investigate. States reflect what information exists, not what procedurally should exist.


## Forensic Evaluation and Death Investigation

Anyone with the Forensic Evaluation skill can examine a corpse. When they do, the ledger entry transitions from Unexamined to Examined and receives a forensic update. This update is generated automatically based on what the examiner's skill level reveals.

**Forensic Evaluation is skill-based.** The information revealed depends on the examiner's skill level:

### Skill Level Information Revealed

**Novice (Low Skill):**
- **Method of death** — Basic weapon type or cause (blade, blunt weapon, magic, poison)

**Intermediate (Medium Skill):**
- **Method of death** — Detailed weapon type and trauma pattern
- **Time of death** — When the killing occurred

**Advanced (High Skill):**
- **Method of death** — Precise weapon type, trauma pattern, and capability indicators
- **Time of death** — Precise timing estimate
- **Killer identity** — Who killed them (if detectable)

**Expert (Maximum Skill):**
- **Method of death** — Complete forensic analysis including weapon, technique, training level
- **Time of death** — Exact timing
- **Killer identity** — Who killed them
- **Killer location** — General direction of where the murderer currently is (tracking information)

The ledger automatically records both the forensic findings and the name of the person who discovered this information. This creates accountability for investigations and documents who examined which deaths.

### Why This Matters in a Permadeath Shard

In a world where death is permanent, accurate death investigation becomes critical. The Forensic Evaluation skill system ensures:
- Skilled investigators provide valuable information about murders
- Players can pursue killers using tracking information from expert examination
- The quality of investigation depends on player skill investment, not arbitrary role assignment
- Multiple people can investigate the same death, potentially revealing different levels of detail


## Addenda and Commentary

Anyone who investigates a death may choose to add authored addenda to ledger entries. These addenda are optional, discretionary, and reflective of the investigator's judgment, bias, and priorities. They represent the investigator's interpretation of evidence rather than the evidence itself.

An addendum may include:


- Witness interviews and testimony summaries
- Conflicting accounts from multiple sources
- Observed procedural gaps or irregularities
- Patterns across multiple deaths
- Personal judgment on whether the death was lawful, justified, or suspicious
- Recommendations for further investigation or charges

When an investigator publishes an addendum, the ledger entry transitions to Annotated. The addendum appears alongside the baseline entry and forensic update without overwriting them. This layered structure preserves the distinction between fact (death occurred), observation (corpse showed these indicators), and judgment (this death was suspicious).


### Multiple Addenda

Multiple investigators may publish separate addenda for the same death. These addenda may agree, contradict, or focus on different aspects of the death. The ledger preserves all addenda as a record of how different people interpreted the same evidence differently.

A death with three addenda — one declaring it a lawful execution, one calling it murder, one noting insufficient evidence to determine — becomes historical evidence that authorities disagreed. The ledger does not resolve this disagreement. It documents that disagreement existed.


### Addenda as Political Acts

Publishing an addendum is a political act. An investigator who writes detailed addenda for every custody death creates pressure on the Guard to justify its actions. An investigator who ignores deaths in certain districts signals that those deaths do not matter (or that they lack the skill to investigate them). An investigator who focuses exclusively on deaths involving particular houses reveals bias that undermines their credibility.

The ledger does not judge whether these choices are appropriate. It records them. Over time, patterns in what investigators examine reveal as much as the investigations themselves.


## Access and Visibility

The Public Death Ledger is readable by the realm. It is not restricted to officials, nobles, or specific roles. Any citizen may consult the ledger to learn who has died, when, and what is known about their deaths.

This unrestricted access serves multiple purposes:


- Families may learn when relatives have died
- Magistrates may use entries as evidence in trials
- Political actors may use entries to question regime legitimacy
- The public may form judgments about who is safe and who is not

High offices — Crown, Magistrate, Coroner — may reference ledger entries formally in official proceedings. These references carry institutional weight because the ledger is treated as authoritative. "According to the Public Death Ledger" is not speculation; it is citation of official record.


### Entries Cannot Be Erased

Once created, ledger entries are permanent. No authority can remove an entry, modify the baseline facts, or suppress forensic updates. The King cannot erase evidence of executions. The Marshal cannot delete custody deaths. The Coroner cannot retroactively change forensic findings.

Entries can only be supplemented. New addenda may be added. Additional Coroners may publish their own interpretations. But the original entry — that a named individual died at a specific time and place — persists as unchangeable fact.

This permanence ensures the ledger functions as institutional memory that survives regime changes. When a new King takes the throne, they inherit both the power and the documented history of how previous rulers used that power.


## What the Ledger Is Not

The Public Death Ledger is not an investigative system. It does not determine who killed someone. It does not assign guilt. It does not conduct inquiries or interrogate suspects. It records what is known, not who is responsible.

The ledger is not a permission gate. It does not authorize or prohibit arrests. It does not prevent executions. It does not block violence. It does not trigger automatic consequences. A death with multiple suspicious indicators does not mechanically result in charges, trials, or punishment. It creates evidence that other authorities may choose to act upon.

The ledger is not controlled by any single role. The Coroner does not own the ledger. The Crown does not direct it. The Magistrate does not oversee it. The ledger exists independently as institutional infrastructure that all authorities interact with but none control.

The ledger does not declare murder. An entry may show a death occurred while the deceased was in custody, with signs of sustained beating and no execution documentation. This creates the appearance of murder, but the ledger itself makes no such determination. The Magistrate may declare murder. The Coroner may judge the death unlawful. The ledger simply records what was observed.

The ledger does not require Coroner action to exist. Baseline entries are created automatically. A realm without an active Coroner still generates death records. Those records remain unexamined, containing only name, time, and location, but they exist. Coroner absence impoverishes the ledger but does not erase it.


## Political and Social Impact

The Public Death Ledger transforms isolated deaths into patterns. A single custody death may be dismissed as tragic but excusable. Ten custody deaths in a month become evidence of regime brutality. Twenty deaths in a specific district become evidence of targeted violence. The ledger does not create these patterns — it makes them visible.

This visibility operates asymmetrically. High-profile deaths receive scrutiny, investigation, and addenda. Common deaths remain unexamined. Noble deaths compel Coroner attention; peasant deaths accumulate unnoticed until someone chooses to count them. This asymmetry is by design, not flaw. The ledger records all deaths equally but does not force equal attention.


### Patterns Expose Regimes, Not Individuals

The ledger is most powerful when consulted in aggregate rather than individually. A single death tells little. A hundred deaths reveal priorities. If custody deaths cluster around one ethnic group, the regime's enforcement becomes racialized even if no individual guard admits bias. If deaths during arrest increase after a new Marshal is appointed, the connection becomes apparent even if the Marshal never explicitly authorized brutality.

These patterns are not mechanical. They do not automatically weaken a regime's power. They weaken legitimacy, which is a slower and more uncertain form of damage. A regime that loses legitimacy faces rebellion, defection, and succession challenges over time. The ledger documents the causes long before the consequences become visible.


### Silence as Political Power

Choosing not to investigate a death is as politically meaningful as investigating it. When a noble dies and the Coroner publishes a detailed addendum within hours, but a commoner dies and the entry remains unexamined for weeks, the disparity speaks. When deaths in one house receive immediate attention but deaths in another house accumulate without comment, the pattern reveals priorities.

These silences become visible through the ledger. A death marked Unexamined three months after it occurred is evidence of neglect, indifference, or deliberate avoidance. The ledger does not judge why examination never occurred. It documents that it did not, which is often sufficient for political observers to draw conclusions.


### Attention Is Uneven by Design

The ledger ensures all deaths are recorded. It does not ensure all deaths receive equal investigation, public attention, or political consequence. A noble's death becomes a scandal. A peasant's death becomes a statistic. This reflects the realm's values, not the ledger's limitations.

The ledger enables those who wish to challenge this asymmetry to do so. A Magistrate may cite ledger patterns as evidence that the Guard targets specific groups. An opposition house may use ledger data to argue the regime values some lives over others.

The ledger does not force these arguments to succeed. It provides the ammunition for them to be made.


> The ledger records that a life ended.Everything else is what the realm chooses to do with that knowledge.
