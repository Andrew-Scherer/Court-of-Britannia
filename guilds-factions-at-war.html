            When rival factions hold positions in the same government,<br>
            the question is not whether conflict will occur —<br>
            but whether the King can survive it.
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Core Tension</h2>
        
        <p>Britain allows players to hold both <strong>court positions AND guild/faction leadership</strong> simultaneously. This creates a fundamental tension: when your guild goes to war with another faction, but that faction's leader sits on the King's council, what happens?</p>
        
        <p>This isn't a bug. It's the entire point.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout history, governments have been staffed by people with conflicting loyalties, rival houses, and competing factions. The question was never "How do we prevent conflict?" It was "How do we manage it without collapse?"</p>
        
        <h2>Historical Parallel: The Wars of the Roses (1455-1487)</h2>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>York vs Lancaster in the Same Government</h3>
            <p>The Wars of the Roses weren't just battles between armies — they were conflicts between <strong>rival noble houses holding positions in the same royal government</strong>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The Setup:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>House of York</strong> and <strong>House of Lancaster</strong> were both branches of the Plantagenet dynasty</li>
                <li>Both houses had members serving as royal advisors, military commanders, and regional governors</li>
                <li>King Henry VI (Lancaster) appointed Yorkist nobles to his council to maintain peace</li>
                <li>The result: <strong>a government staffed by people actively plotting against each other</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>What Happened:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Richard, Duke of York served as <strong>Lord Protector</strong> (essentially Regent) while plotting to take the throne</li>
                <li>Yorkist nobles held military commands and used them to position forces for rebellion</li>
                <li>Lancaster loyalists in government leaked plans, sabotaged appointments, and undermined York at every turn</li>
                <li>When war broke out, each side's government positions became strategic assets</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Rival factions holding government positions creates a <strong>cold war within the state</strong> that can erupt into open conflict at any moment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Scenario 1: Warring Factions in the Same Court</h2>
        
        <div class="scenario">
            <h4>The Setup</h4>
            <p>The <strong>Merchant's Guild</strong> and the <strong>Thieves' Guild</strong> are at war over control of trade routes. But:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Merchant Guildmaster is also the <strong>King's Steward</strong> (controls land deeds and property)</li>
                <li>The Thieves' Guild leader is the <strong>Marshal of the Guard</strong> (controls law enforcement)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>What Happens</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The Steward uses property evictions to target Thieves' Guild safe houses</li>
                <li>The Marshal uses arrest powers to jail Merchant Guild members on fabricated charges</li>
                <li>Each accuses the other of abusing their office for factional gain</li>
                <li>The King must choose: fire one (and make an enemy), fire both (and lose competent officers), or let it escalate</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Historical Parallel: The Guelphs and Ghibellines</h4>
            <p>In Medieval Italy (13th-14th centuries), rival factions — the <strong>Guelphs</strong> (pro-Pope) and <strong>Ghibellines</strong> (pro-Emperor) — held positions in the same city governments across Florence, Siena, and other city-states.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Guelph magistrates would convict Ghibellines of crimes to seize their property</li>
                <li>Ghibelline military commanders would "accidentally" fail to defend Guelph neighborhoods during attacks</li>
                <li>Entire city councils would flip between factions through coups, purges, and assassinations</li>
                <li>The result: <strong>decades of civil war within the same governments</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Scenario 2: Your Faction at War with Your Superior's Faction</h2>
        
        <div class="scenario">
            <h4>The Setup</h4>
            <p>You are a <strong>City Guard</strong> and member of the <strong>Order of the Silver Hand</strong> (religious faction). Your commander, the <strong>Marshal</strong>, leads the <strong>Shadowclan</strong> (assassin faction). The two factions are now at war.</p>
            
            <h4>What Happens</h4>
            <p>You face impossible choices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If you obey the Marshal's orders</strong> — You betray your faction by enforcing his agenda</li>
                <li><strong>If you disobey</strong> — You face dismissal, arrest, or execution for insubordination</li>
                <li><strong>If you leak information to your faction</strong> — You commit treason against the Crown</li>
                <li><strong>If you resign</strong> — You lose your position, income, and influence</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Player Agency</h4>
            <p>This is not a system failure. This is <strong>meaningful choice under pressure</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do you value your court position or your faction loyalty more?</li>
                <li>Can you play both sides without being caught?</li>
                <li>Can you engineer the Marshal's removal and replace him with a faction ally?</li>
                <li>Can you broker peace between the factions to resolve the conflict?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Historical Parallel: The French Religious Wars</h4>
            <p>During the French Wars of Religion (1562-1598), Catholic and Huguenot (Protestant) nobles held positions in the same royal government under Kings Francis II, Charles IX, and Henry III.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Military commanders from opposing religions were ordered to fight <em>together</em> against external enemies while their factions warred at home</li>
                <li>Some obeyed orders and fought their religious enemies later</li>
                <li>Some deserted, taking troops with them to join their faction's armies</li>
                <li>Some were assassinated by subordinates loyal to the rival religion</li>
                <li>The St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre (1572) began as a <strong>purge of Huguenot nobles from government positions</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Scenario 3: Justice Is Never Blind</h2>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Question:</strong> How does a Guard give justice fairly to a person his Guild/Faction is at war with?
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Answer: He probably doesn't.</strong></p>
        
        <div class="scenario">
            <h4>The Reality of Factional Justice</h4>
            <p>When a Guard belongs to a faction, his interpretation of law becomes a weapon:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Selective enforcement</strong> — "Crimes" committed by faction enemies are prosecuted aggressively; identical acts by allies are ignored</li>
                <li><strong>Evidence fabrication</strong> — "I saw him attack first" (even when he didn't)</li>
                <li><strong>Harsh vs lenient sentencing</strong> — Faction enemies get maximum punishment; allies get warnings</li>
                <li><strong>Delayed response</strong> — "We arrived too late" when faction enemies call for help</li>
                <li><strong>Protective custody</strong> — Arresting faction allies "for their safety" to shield them from legitimate consequences</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>This Is Not a Bug</h4>
            <p>This is <strong>historically accurate behavior</strong>. Throughout history, law enforcement has been weaponized by those in power against their enemies.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sheriffs of Nottingham</strong> (actual historical figures, not just legend) were political appointees who used law enforcement to persecute rivals of their patrons</li>
                <li><strong>Roman Praetors</strong> could delay or deny justice to political enemies while fast-tracking cases for allies</li>
                <li><strong>Tudor England</strong>: Royal justices served at the King's pleasure and prosecuted his enemies with fabricated treason charges</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>The Counterbalance</h4>
            <p>This doesn't mean justice is impossible. It means justice requires <strong>political pressure</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public trials</strong> — Witnesses force visible due process</li>
                <li><strong>Magistrate oversight</strong> — An independent Magistrate can overrule Guard bias</li>
                <li><strong>Rival factions in government</strong> — A Yorkist Guard is checked by a Lancaster Magistrate</li>
                <li><strong>King intervention</strong> — The Crown can force impartiality (if the King cares)</li>
                <li><strong>Reputation damage</strong> — Blatant corruption erodes legitimacy</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Scenario 4: The New King's Purge</h2>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Question:</strong> What happens when a new King inherits a cabinet full of faction/guild rivals?
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Answer: He probably kicks them all out.</strong></p>
        
        <div class="scenario">
            <h4>The Succession Purge</h4>
            <p>When a new King takes the throne, he inherits a government staffed by the <strong>previous King's allies</strong>. If the new King comes from a rival faction, every appointee is a potential enemy.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The New King's Options:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Total purge</strong> — Fire everyone, appoint faction loyalists</li>
                <li><strong>Selective retention</strong> — Keep competent neutrals, remove faction enemies</li>
                <li><strong>Forced loyalty oaths</strong> — Demand public declarations of support</li>
                <li><strong>Cooptation</strong> — Bribe or threaten rivals into switching sides</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Why This Happens:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The new King cannot trust officers loyal to rival factions</li>
                <li>Leaving enemies in power positions invites coups and sabotage</li>
                <li>The new King must reward his own faction supporters who helped him gain the throne</li>
                <li>Purging rivals demonstrates strength and consolidates power</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Historical Examples</h4>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Henry VII (England, 1485)</h3>
                <p>When Henry VII (Lancaster) defeated Richard III (York) at Bosworth Field, he inherited a government staffed entirely by Yorkist appointees.</p>
                <p><strong>Henry's response:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Immediately arrested and executed Richard's closest supporters</li>
                    <li>Stripped Yorkist nobles of offices and lands through Acts of Attainder</li>
                    <li>Replaced the entire Privy Council with Lancaster loyalists</li>
                    <li>Offered amnesty to minor Yorkists who swore loyalty — most refused and were exiled</li>
                    <li>Spent his entire reign fighting Yorkist claimants who continued plotting against him</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Catherine the Great (Russia, 1762)</h3>
                <p>Catherine took power through a coup against her husband, Tsar Peter III. She inherited his government, staffed by officials loyal to him.</p>
                <p><strong>Catherine's response:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Forced Peter's supporters to resign "voluntarily" (threat of execution)</li>
                    <li>Exiled or imprisoned those who resisted</li>
                    <li>Appointed her faction allies (military officers who staged the coup) to all major positions</li>
                    <li>Executed Peter VI within weeks to prevent him from becoming a rival rallying point</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Augustus Caesar (Rome, 27 BC)</h3>
                <p>After defeating Mark Antony, Augustus inherited a Senate filled with Antony's supporters.</p>
                <p><strong>Augustus's response:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Purged the Senate through "voluntary" retirements (backed by military threat)</li>
                    <li>Filled vacant seats with his own supporters</li>
                    <li>Created new offices and appointed loyalists to them</li>
                    <li>Those who resisted were exiled, stripped of property, or executed for "conspiracy"</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h4>The Counter-Strategy: Survival Through Neutrality</h4>
            <p>Not everyone gets purged. Some court officials survive regime changes by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Demonstrating competence</strong> — "I serve the Crown, not the King"</li>
                <li><strong>Public disavowal</strong> — Distancing themselves from the previous regime</li>
                <li><strong>Offering intelligence</strong> — Betraying their former allies to prove loyalty</li>
                <li><strong>Bribery</strong> — Paying for the privilege of keeping their position</li>
                <li><strong>Marriage alliances</strong> — Creating family ties to the new King's faction</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Design Philosophy</h2>
        
        <p>These scenarios are not problems to solve. They are <strong>the gameplay</strong>.</p>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Why This System Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Player agency</strong> — You choose between loyalty to court vs loyalty to faction</li>
                <li><strong>Meaningful consequences</strong> — Every choice creates enemies and allies</li>
                <li><strong>Emergent drama</strong> — No scripted events needed; conflict arises naturally from structure</li>
                <li><strong>Historical accuracy</strong> — This is how governments actually functioned</li>
                <li><strong>Permadeath stakes</strong> — Betrayal can mean permanent character loss, raising the tension</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>The question is never "How do we prevent conflicts of interest?" The question is: "<strong>When will you betray your faction? When will you betray the Crown? And what will you do when forced to choose?</strong>"</p>
        
        <h2>Practical Outcomes</h2>
        
        <p><strong>For Players:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Holding both a court position and faction leadership makes you powerful but vulnerable</li>
            <li>Every appointment is a political calculation: "Can I trust this person?"</li>
            <li>Justice becomes negotiable based on who has power</li>
            <li>Regime changes are existential threats to officeholders</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>For Kings:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must balance rival factions in government or risk civil war</li>
            <li>Purging too many officials leaves you without competent administrators</li>
            <li>Keeping rivals in power invites coups and sabotage</li>
            <li>Your success depends on managing these tensions, not eliminating them</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>For Factions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Placing members in court positions is strategic infiltration</li>
