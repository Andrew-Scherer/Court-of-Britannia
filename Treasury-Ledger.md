# 🏛️ Royal Treasury Ledger

**Visibility Without Control**

---

## Core Principle

> **Constitutional Statement:**
>
> "Visibility is not power. It is accountability."

The Royal Treasury Ledger does not move gold. It does not authorize spending. It does not approve policy. It does not grant exemptions or enforce austerity.

The ledger makes outcomes undeniable.

---

## What the Royal Treasury Ledger Is

The Royal Treasury Ledger is a **read-only financial record**. It reflects the current and historical state of the city treasury. It exists independently of who is online. It updates automatically through system events.

**Operational Rules:**

- No manual entries
- No discretionary edits
- No retroactive corrections

The ledger observes reality. It does not construct it.

---

## What the Ledger Shows (Authoritative Scope)

The Master of the Treasury and the Crown have full read access to the following information:

### Current State

- **Current treasury balance** — the gold available at this moment

### Inflow

- **Daily tax revenue (aggregated):** Total collected from all tax categories
- **NPC fees and premiums:** Revenue captured from system purchases
- **Property-related income:** Taxes on land sales and transfers
- **Other system-generated revenue:** Fines, bounties, and miscellaneous city income

### Outflow

- **Daily wage payouts:** Actual gold paid to all seated roles
- **Bounty payments:** Rewards distributed through the justice system
- **Other automatic system sinks:** Governance costs and city expenses

### Projection Layer

- **Payroll projections based on filled roles:** Expected daily wage obligations under current staffing
- **Deficit forecasts under current policy:** Projected timeline to shortfall if revenue trends continue
- **Estimated days until partial or failed wages:** Warning threshold for insolvency

**Critical Limitation:**

Forecasts are informational. They do not block policy. They do not force action. They provide visibility, not control.

## What This Ledger Does Not Do

To prevent confusion with active systems, the following actions are **explicitly not performed by the Royal Treasury Ledger:**

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Set tax rates | ❌ Not performed by this ledger |
| Collect taxes | ❌ Not performed by this ledger |
| Pay wages | ❌ Not performed by this ledger |
| Approve spending | ❌ Not performed by this ledger |
| Exempt individuals or roles | ❌ Not performed by this ledger |
| Enforce austerity | ❌ Not performed by this ledger |

This ledger observes. It does not act.

## Difference Between the Treasury Ledger and the Tax Ledger

The Royal Treasury Ledger and the Tax Ledger serve distinct constitutional functions. They are complementary, not redundant.

| Tax Ledger | Royal Treasury Ledger |
|------------|----------------------|
| Records policy | Records outcomes |
| Shows rates | Shows balances |
| Logs proposals and changes | Tracks what remains |
| Tracks what is being taken | Reveals whether policy worked |
| Public access | Restricted access |
| Documents authority | Documents consequence |

> **Constitutional Distinction:**
>
> "The Tax Ledger records intention. The Treasury Ledger records reality."

A city may set aggressive tax policy (recorded in the Tax Ledger) and still face insolvency (recorded in the Treasury Ledger). The Tax Ledger shows what was chosen. The Treasury Ledger shows what happened.

## Political Function of Treasury Visibility

Visibility creates political pressure. The Royal Treasury Ledger does not enforce consequences — it makes consequences undeniable.

**Effects of Ledger Visibility:**

- **Warnings become credible:** The Master of the Treasury can cite exact balances and projected timelines
- **Insolvency cannot be denied:** When the treasury balance reaches zero, the ledger records it
- **Underpayment becomes public fact:** Failed wage payments appear in the ledger with timestamps
- **Leadership absorbs blame for outcomes:** The ledger does not judge — it provides evidence for others to judge

**Critical Limitations:**

- The Master of the Treasury cannot fix shortfalls alone — only the Crown can authorize policy changes
- Silence is itself a political choice — inaction is recorded as tacit acceptance of consequences

The ledger does not create political will. It removes the excuse of ignorance.

---

## Offline Continuity Rule

The Royal Treasury Ledger operates continuously, regardless of player presence.

**While No One Is Online:**

- Ledger updates continue
- Revenue accrues automatically
- Wages attempt to pay on schedule
- Shortfalls record automatically
- Projections recalculate based on current data

**When Players Return:**

- They respond to recorded reality
- They do not decide whether events occurred
- They do not retroactively adjust outcomes

The city's fiscal state does not pause when leadership is absent. The ledger reflects what happened, not what was convenient.
