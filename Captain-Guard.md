## What Captains Do

Captains of the Guard provide redundancy in leadership so that enforcement does not collapse when one person is unavailable. They lead day-to-day operations, supervise guards, and act with Marshal authority when the Marshal is absent.

Captains occupy the middle tier of guard command—close enough to the street to understand enforcement realities, high enough in the hierarchy to shape policy and make strategic decisions.


## Core Responsibilities


### Operational Leadership


- **Lead patrols and enforcement actions** — Coordinate guard deployments and responses
- **Supervise City Guards** — Provide direction, training, and performance oversight
- **Appoint new City Guards** — Recruit and induct guards into service
- **Dismiss guards for cause** — Remove ineffective or disloyal guards
- **Execute Marshal's orders** — Implement enforcement priorities and standing orders


### Acting Marshal Authority

When the Marshal is absent, Captains collectively assume command authority. This includes:


- Issuing arrest orders
- Deploying guards to emergencies
- Making tactical decisions about use of force
- Coordinating with other authorities (Crown, Magistrate)
- Representing the Guard in official proceedings


### Guard Development

Captains shape the culture and effectiveness of the guard force:


- Train new guards in procedures and tactics
- Mentor guards on proper use of force and restraint
- Review arrest records and provide feedback
- Build guard cohesion and morale
- Identify potential future Captains from the ranks


## Political Position and Power


### Loyalty Networks

Captains appoint individual guards, creating personal loyalty networks. These relationships become politically significant during crises:


- Guards often follow "their" Captain more readily than distant authority
- Captains who recruit strategically build loyal followings
- During succession crises, guards may split along Captain loyalties
- A Captain with strong guard loyalty can challenge the Marshal's authority


### Multiple Captains: Redundancy or Division?

Having three Captains creates both stability and risk:


> **Note**
> **Benefits of Multiple Captains**
>
> - Guard operations continue if one Captain is unavailable
> - Different Captains can specialize (patrols, investigations, castle security)
> - Workload distribution prevents burnout
> - Multiple perspectives improve decision-making


> **❗ Note**
> - Captains may issue contradictory orders
> - Guards may play Captains against each other
> - During succession crises, Captains may choose different claimants
> - Ambitious Captains may compete for Marshal position
> - Split guard force = split loyalties = civil conflict


## Relationship With Other Authorities


### The Marshal

Captains serve the Marshal but are not powerless subordinates:


- **Execute Marshal's vision** — Implement enforcement policy on the ground
- **Provide field intelligence** — Report what's actually happening in the city
- **Challenge impractical orders** — Advise when Marshal's directives won't work
- **Succeed the Marshal** — Often promoted to Marshal when the position opens

A Captain who undermines the Marshal can create parallel authority. A Captain who refuses Marshal orders signals regime fracture.


### Other Captains

Captains must coordinate and cooperate, but tensions arise:


- Jurisdiction disputes (whose guards respond where)
- Resource competition (limited guards for multiple priorities)
- Different enforcement philosophies (harsh vs lenient)
- Personal rivalries and ambitions


### City Guards

Guards respect Captains who:


- Lead from the front during dangerous situations
- Support guards who face false accusations
- Provide clear guidance and backing
- Treat guards fairly and consistently

Guards lose respect for Captains who:


- Issue impossible or contradictory orders
- Avoid accountability when things go wrong
- Play favorites or show corruption
- Appear weak or indecisive


## Succession Crises and Guard Splits

When Britain's authority fragments, Captains face the same impossible choice as the Marshal: **Which claimant do we serve?**

But unlike the Marshal, there are **three Captains**. This creates additional complexity:


### Possible Outcomes During Succession Crisis


- **All three Captains align** — Guard force remains unified; succession decided by collective choice
- **Captains split between claimants** — Guard force fractures; guards follow "their" Captain
- **One Captain seizes authority** — Claims acting Marshal role; other Captains resist or submit
- **Captains declare neutrality** — Attempt to avoid choosing; pressure mounts until choice is forced

**A guard force split three ways cannot maintain order. Someone must yield or be eliminated.**


## Path to Power

The Captain role is politically significant as a stepping stone to greater authority:


### Becoming Marshal

When the Marshal position opens (death, dismissal, resignation), Captains are natural successors. The King often promotes from within because:


- Captains already know guard operations
- Captains have existing guard loyalty
- Captains have proven themselves under the previous Marshal
- External appointments risk guard resistance


### Seizing Authority

An ambitious Captain can become Marshal without appointment:


- **During Marshal absence** — Acts as Marshal, then refuses to relinquish authority
- **After Marshal failure** — Steps in when Marshal loses guard confidence
- **By guard demand** — Guards insist on Captain's leadership over failing Marshal
- **Through crisis leadership** — Assumes temporary control, makes it permanent


## Duties and Limits


### What Captains Can Do


- Lead enforcement operations and patrols
- Appoint and dismiss City Guards
- Issue arrest orders to guards under their command
- Act with Marshal authority when Marshal is absent
- Coordinate with other Captains on operations
- Recommend policy changes to the Marshal


### What Captains Cannot Do (Without Marshal Authority)


- ❌ Set guard-wide enforcement policy
- ❌ Appoint or dismiss other Captains
- ❌ Override the Marshal's orders
- ❌ Execute prisoners
- ❌ Pardon or release prisoners without proper authority


## Why Play This Role?

Captains of the Guard are for players who want:


- **Field leadership** — Lead guards in actual operations, not just issue orders from afar
- **Recruitment authority** — Build a personal guard force loyal to you
- **Political position** — Influence enforcement without being the primary target
- **Path to Marshal** — Natural stepping stone to ultimate guard command
- **Tactical decisions** — Make real-time choices about force, arrests, and escalation

**This is mid-tier command with significant autonomy and political leverage.**


## Summary


- Captains provide redundancy in guard leadership and lead day-to-day operations
- Appointed by Marshal; can appoint unlimited City Guards
- Act with Marshal authority when the Marshal is absent
- Build personal loyalty networks through guard appointments
- Three Captains create both stability and potential for divided loyalty
- During succession crises, Captains may split, fracturing the guard force
- Natural stepping stone to becoming Marshal
- Field leadership role with tactical decision-making authority
