**Commander of Britain's Internal Forces**

---


## Role Overview


| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Position | Marshal of the Guard |
| Number of Positions | 1 |
| Appointed By | The King |
| Can Appoint | Captains of the Guard (3 maximum) |
| Reports To | The King |
| Function | Command all Guards; enforce decrees; maintain internal order |


## What the Marshal Does

The Marshal of the Guard commands all guards, sets enforcement policy, and represents the Crown's capacity for violence within Britain. This position combines operational command with profound political significance.

**A competent Marshal makes the King's rule effective. An incompetent or disloyal Marshal renders the Crown powerless.**


> **❗ Note**
> The Marshal occupies what is often called "the most dangerous office in Britain" — not to the Marshal, but to the King. Throughout history, those who command armed forces often replace those they ostensibly serve.


## Core Responsibilities


### Command Authority


- **Appoints and dismisses Captains** — Builds the command structure
- **Issues standing orders** — Defines enforcement priorities and procedures
- **Sets rules of engagement** — Determines when force is justified and what level
- **Coordinates with Crown** — Advises on security matters and implements royal decrees
- **Manages guard assignments** — Determines patrol routes, castle security, event coverage


### Enforcement Policy

The Marshal decides:


- Which decrees receive priority enforcement
- How guards respond to specific situations
- When to escalate from warnings to arrests
- What constitutes justified use of force
- How to handle conflicting orders from different authorities


### Crisis Management

When order breaks down, the Marshal:


- Deploys guards to control riots or violence
- Secures critical locations (castle, treasury, jail)
- Coordinates with Military if external threats approach the city
- Implements emergency protocols
- Reports situation assessments to the Crown


## Political Power and Danger

The Marshal's power extends far beyond simple law enforcement:


### What the Marshal Controls


- **Access to the King** — Guards control who enters the castle
- **Enforcement priorities** — Whose violations are punished, whose are ignored
- **Armed force within the city** — The only organized violence the Crown can deploy internally
- **Arrest authority** — Can detain anyone, including nobles (with consequences)
- **Intelligence networks** — Guards observe everything; the Marshal knows what they know


### How a Marshal Becomes a Threat


> **❗ Note**
> A Marshal can undermine or replace the Crown through:
> - **Selective enforcement** — Protecting allies, prosecuting rivals
> - **Loyalty networks** — Appointing Captains who serve the Marshal over the King
> - **Access control** — Isolating the King from advisors and supporters
> - **Crisis exploitation** — "Temporarily" assuming authority during emergencies
> - **Refusing orders** — When guards don't obey the King, the Marshal is the de facto ruler


### Historical Precedent

Rome's Praetorian Guard:


- Assassinated emperors
- Auctioned the throne to the highest bidder
- Installed soldiers as Caesars
- Became kingmakers rather than king-protectors

**The lesson: Proximity to violence, ability to act decisively, and loyalty of armed subordinates often trumps traditional legitimacy.**


## Relationship With Other Authorities


### The Crown

The Marshal serves the King but is not powerless before them. The relationship is mutual dependency:


- The King needs the Marshal to enforce decrees
- The Marshal needs the King to provide legitimacy
- When this breaks down, power flows to whoever controls the guards


### The Magistrate

The Magistrate can:


- Declare arrests unlawful
- Challenge use of force
- Demand prisoner releases
- Investigate guard conduct

The Marshal can:


- Ignore the Magistrate (at political cost)
- Arrest the Magistrate (at extreme political cost)
- Cooperate to maintain legitimacy


### The Lord of the Royal Army (Military)

**Critical relationship:**


- **If aligned** — Britain becomes authoritarian; combined internal + external force under unified command
- **If opposed** — Britain fractures; guards vs military creates civil conflict risk
- **If coordinated but independent** — Healthy balance of internal law enforcement and external defense


## Succession Crises and Guard Loyalty

When the King dies or authority is contested, the Marshal faces an impossible choice: **Which claimant do the guards serve?**


### The Marshal's Decision Shapes Outcomes


- **Supports Heir** — Legitimizes traditional succession
- **Supports Regent** — Enables continued governance during transition
- **Supports rival Claimant** — Triggers civil war
- **Declares neutrality** — Creates power vacuum; guards often split anyway
- **Seizes power personally** — "Temporary" authority during crisis becomes permanent

**The guards follow the Marshal. When the Marshal chooses, the succession is often decided.**


## Duties and Limits


### What the Marshal Can Do


- Issue arrest orders
- Deploy guards anywhere in Britain
- Set enforcement priorities and standing orders
- Appoint and dismiss Captains
- Coordinate guard response to threats and crises
- Review and approve use of force incidents
- Access all guard records and reports


### What the Marshal Cannot Do


- ❌ Execute prisoners (only the Executioner may carry out capital punishment)
- ❌ Pardon or release prisoners without Crown or Magistrate authority
- ❌ Override Magistrate rulings without consequences
- ❌ Deploy Military forces (that authority belongs to the Lord of the Royal Army)
- ❌ Make law (the Marshal enforces; the Crown and Magistrate define)


## Why Play This Role?

The Marshal of the Guard is for players who want:


- **Command authority** — Lead an organization with real power
- **Political leverage** — Shape enforcement policy and protect allies
- **Strategic influence** — Decide which laws matter and which don't
- **Crisis leadership** — Step into the spotlight when order breaks down
- **Temptation** — The slow realization that you could rule, not just serve

**This is one of the most politically powerful positions in Britain, second only to the King.**
