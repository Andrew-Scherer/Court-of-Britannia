# ⚔️ Claimants

**Contested Blood — Power Through Force**

---


> **Note**


## What Is a Claimant?

A **Claimant** is any player who:


- Believes they have a **legitimate claim** to the throne (merit, conquest, etc.)
- Challenges the official Heir or other claimants for succession rights
- Has **NO official endorsement** from the previous King
- Must **prove their claim through action** — military force, political maneuvering, or assassination

Claimants emerge especially during **succession crises** — when a King dies without an Heir, or when the Heir is weak, contested, or blocked from coronation.


## Claimant vs. Heir vs. Regent

When a King dies, three types of power contenders may emerge:


| Aspect | Heir Presumptive | Regent | Claimant |
|---|---|---|---|
| Official Recognition | ✅ Yes (appointed by King) | ✅ Yes (appointed by King) | ❌ No (self-declared) |
| Claim to Throne | ✅ Strongest (official designation) | ❌ None (unless self-declared) | ⚠️ Contested (heritage/merit/force) |
| King Powers | ❌ None | ✅ Full delegated authority | ❌ None (unless they seize control) |
| Path to Crown | Coronation (official) | Self-crown (usurpation) | Conflict, alliance, or self-crown |
| Legitimacy | High (King's endorsement) | Low (no claim to throne) | Variable (depends on support) |
| Risk Level | High (target for assassination) | Medium (depends on loyalty) | Very High (outlaws if they fail) |


> **Note**

See [[What Happens When the King Dies|Succession]] for the full three-way dynamic.


## Why Claimants Emerge

Claimants arise in specific political conditions:


### 1. No Official Heir Exists

If the King dies **without appointing an Heir**, the Crown becomes a free-for-all. Any player with a plausible claim may declare themselves a Claimant and race to coronation.


### 2. The Heir Is Weak or Contested

If the official Heir is:


- Unpopular or seen as illegitimate
- Imprisoned or blocked by the Regent
- Killed before they can be crowned

Then rival Claimants may challenge their right to the throne.


### 3. Merit-Based Claims

Some Claimants argue they **deserve** the throne based on:


- Military prowess or conquest
- Wealth, land ownership, or political influence
- Service to the realm


### 5. Power Vacuums

When a King dies and both the Heir and Regent are absent, weak, or killed, the realm enters **Interregnum** — a state of chaos where anyone can claim the throne.


## Can a Claimant Hold Official Court Positions?


> **Note**
> **🔥 Critical Rule: Role-Stacking is Allowed**
>
> **Yes.** A player can be a member of a Guild **AND** a Faction (which is a layer on top of guilds) **AND** also hold an official role in Court and Crown.
> **Important:** Factions are NOT separate from guilds — they are **voluntary alignment layers that guilds join**. You're a guild member first, and your guild may choose to align with a faction.
> **This means:**
> - A **King can ALSO lead a guild** that is aligned with a faction
> - A **Marshal can ALSO lead a military guild** that flies a faction banner
> - A **Magistrate can ALSO head a guild** that is part of a religious faction
> - A **Claimant can ALSO hold** Marshal, Magistrate, or other court offices while leading a guild aligned with a faction
> **The only restriction:** You cannot hold multiple *major court offices* simultaneously (e.g., King + Marshal). But Guild leadership and Faction alignment do NOT count as court offices — they're separate power structures entirely.


### Why This Matters: Title Stacking as Power Fusion

In most pre-modern societies, **Claimants rarely stood alone**. They were backed by — and often *led* — the institutions that gave them power:


- Religious institutions (churches, cults, sacred orders)
- Noble factions (dynastic alliances, great houses)
- Military orders (knight orders, warrior brotherhoods)
- Economic guilds (merchant leagues, craft unions)

Holding a church office, faction leadership, or sacred role alongside a court position:


- **Boosted legitimacy** — "I am not just King, I am also God's chosen representative"
- **Neutralized rivals** — Challenging you means challenging multiple power structures
- **Framed rebellion as heresy or treason** — Opposition becomes morally wrong, not just politically inconvenient
- **Created dual loyalty networks** — Your followers answer to you in multiple capacities


> **❗ Note**


### Historical Parallels: Political + Religious/Factional Fusion


> **Note**
> **📜 The Caliphate Model**
>
> **Caliphs** in Islamic history held both:
> - **Political authority** as rulers and military commanders
> - **Religious authority** as successors to the Prophet and leaders of the faithful
> Challenging a Caliph meant not just political rebellion but **religious apostasy**. This dual authority made them extraordinarily difficult to depose.


> **Note**
> **⛪ Prince-Bishops and Cardinal-Kings**
>
> Medieval Europe saw numerous examples of religious leaders who also held secular power:
> - **Prince-Bishops** — Bishops who ruled territories as feudal lords
> - **Cardinal Richelieu** — Chief Minister of France and a Cardinal of the Catholic Church
> - **Cardinal Wolsey** — Lord Chancellor of England and a Cardinal
> - **Archbishop-Electors** — Religious leaders who elected Holy Roman Emperors
> These figures wielded **both ecclesiastical and temporal power**, making them nearly untouchable.


> **Note**
> **👑 The Holy Roman Emperor**
>
> The Emperor was:
> - **Secular ruler** of the empire
> - **Elected by Prince-Electors** (including Archbishop-Electors)
> - **Crowned by the Pope**, giving religious legitimacy
> This fusion of political power + religious endorsement + electoral backing created a **triple-layer legitimacy** that was extraordinarily difficult to challenge.


> **Note**
> **⚔️ Military Orders with Political Power**
>
> **Knights Templar, Knights Hospitaller, Teutonic Knights:**
> - Religious military orders with their own territories
> - Answered to the Pope, not secular kings
> - Held castles, collected taxes, fielded armies
> - Leaders were both **religious authorities and military commanders**
> The Grand Master of the Teutonic Order eventually became a **ruling prince** of Prussia — merging religious, military, and political authority into one office.


> **Note**
> **🏛️ Merchant-Princes and Guild-Rulers**
>
> **Venice, Florence, and other Italian city-states:**
> - Doges and ruling councils were often **heads of powerful merchant guilds**
> - The Medici family were bankers AND rulers of Florence
> - Economic power and political power were **openly fused**
> Separating "guild leader" from "political ruler" would have been nonsensical in these contexts — they were the same people.


### What This Means for Britannia

In Kingdoms of Britannia, this principle creates dramatic new possibilities:


> A King who is also the High Priest of a religious factioncan frame dissent as heresy.A Marshal who also leads a mercenary guildcontrols both official guards and private armies.A High Emissary who also heads a military guildwields a dangerous combination of both diplomacy and might.A Claimant who leads both a faction AND holds a high ranking noble positionhas legitimacy (official position) + external backing (faction). This makes for a very politically strong combination to make a play for the throne.

This creates **layered power structures** where removing someone from one position doesn't eliminate their influence. It also means:


- **Coups can come from inside** — Your Marshal might already be a faction leader planning to seize the throne
- **Loyalty is complex** — Does a guard follow the Marshal's orders as Marshal, or as leader of their shared guild?
- **Exile doesn't work automatically** — Stripping someone of their court position doesn't also remove their guild/faction power base
- **Assassination is riskier** — Killing a King who also leads a religious faction creates martyrdom + succession crisis + religious war


> **❗ Note**


## Does This Lead to Corruption and Nepotism?


> **Note**
> **🤝 Yes. Obviously.**
>
> **Nepotism and corruption are inevitable consequences of role-stacking.** A King who also leads a merchant guild will appoint guild members to court positions. A Marshal who commands a military order will staff the guards with their faction brothers. A Magistrate who heads a religious order will favor the faithful in legal rulings.
> **This is not a bug. This is human nature.**


### Corruption Is Historically Accurate

Every institution across human history has been affected by nepotism, favoritism, and corruption:


- **Medieval Catholic Church** — Positions sold for money (simony), families controlling bishoprics for generations
- **Royal Courts** — Favorites appointed over competent candidates, family networks dominating offices
- **Guilds** — Master craftsmen ensuring their sons inherited positions, excluding outsiders
- **Military Orders** — Knights favoring their brothers-in-arms for promotions and honors
- **Political Dynasties** — Entire families controlling government for centuries (Borgias, Medicis, etc.)

Attempting to create a "corruption-free" system would be **historically nonsensical** and dramatically sterile.


### Why Game Mechanics Cannot (and Should Not) Prevent Corruption

There is no mechanical way to prevent a King from appointing their friends, guildmates, or faction brothers to positions. Any attempt to do so would:


- **Remove player agency** — "You can't appoint this person" kills political freedom
- **Create arbitrary restrictions** — Who decides what is "corrupt" vs "legitimate"?
- **Eliminate interesting conflicts** — Accusations of nepotism are dramatic content
- **Feel artificial and game-y** — Real power doesn't work that way


> The point is not to prevent corruption.The point is to make corruptionvisible, consequential, and contestable.


### How Permadeath Prevents Stagnant Corruption

The key difference between Britannia and stagnant power structures is **permadeath**:


- **Corrupt rulers die** — A King who fills court with incompetent loyalists creates vulnerability to assassination or coup
- **Networks fracture** — When the guild leader controlling multiple positions dies, their network loses cohesion
- **New players can rise** — Each death creates openings for outsiders to break into power
- **Grudges accumulate** — Extended nepotism creates enemies who remember when power shifts
- **Incompetence has consequences** — Appointing your brother who can't fight makes your guards weak in actual combat

Corruption becomes **temporary** rather than permanent because characters die and power structures collapse.


### Corruption as Content, Not a Problem

In Britannia, accusations of corruption **drive stories**:


> **Note**
> **Dramatic Scenarios Corruption Creates**
>
> - **Public Accusation:** "The King has filled the court with his guild cronies! This is tyranny!"
> - **Reformer Movements:** A challenger promises to "clean house" and appoint based on merit
> - **Internal Rebellion:** Excluded nobles band together to overthrow the corrupt regime
> - **Assassination Justification:** "I killed the Marshal because he was a corrupt guild puppet"
> - **Civil War:** Factions fight over whether the current power structure is legitimate

These are **exactly the kinds of conflicts we want**. Corruption is the spark, not the failure state.


### What Players Can Do About Corruption

While mechanics don't prevent corruption, **players can respond to it**:


| Response | Method |
|---|---|
| Public Condemnation | Call out nepotism publicly, damage the ruler's legitimacy |
| Competitive Merit | Demonstrate superior competence to shame corrupt appointees |
| Alliance Building | Unite excluded factions against the corrupt regime |
| Assassination | Remove corrupt officials through permadeath |
| Coup/Revolution | Overthrow the entire power structure and install new leadership |
| Alternative Institutions | Form rival guilds/factions with different values |


> **❗ Note**


## Resurrection Politics: When the Same Player Returns to Power


> **Note**
> **🔄 The Edge Case**
>
> A King who leads a powerful faction dies (permadeath). His Regent, Heir, guards, and court are all faction members. His **player** respawns as a new character. At the coronation ceremony, the faction crowns **the new character** — putting the same **player** back on the throne.
> **Is this allowed?** Yes.
> **Is this a problem?** No — if players respond to it.


### Why This Is Philosophically Consistent

This scenario is **not** circumventing permadeath. Here's why:


- **The character died permanently** — No resurrection, no respawn with same character sheet
- **The player has no automatic claim** — The new character starts with nothing
- **The faction chose to crown them** — This is an institutional decision, not a mechanical bypass
- **This tests institutional resilience** — If the faction maintained total control through a succession crisis, that proves organizational power


> From Philosophy:"Death tests succession, loyalty, economic upkeep, and institutional resilience. A guild that survives its founder's death proves legitimacy. A faction that collapses when its leader dies was never an organization — it was a personality cult."

If a faction can maintain complete control after their leader's death **and** choose to crown the same player's new character, that demonstrates:


- The faction is real, not a personality cult
- Institutional structures survived the death
- Loyalty transfers to the organization, not just the individual
- The player earned that loyalty through past actions

**This is dynastic/factional control** — exactly the kind of power consolidation that should be possible (and challengeable).


### The Critical Restriction

The philosophy establishes one hard rule: **"No alts holding power simultaneously."**

This means:


- ✅ **Sequential** — Player 1 dies, then Player 1's new character is crowned later = ALLOWED
- ❌ **Simultaneous** — Player 1 is King while also controlling Marshal with an alt = FORBIDDEN

As long as there's true death and succession between characters, the system is working as intended.


### Why This Is Politically Vulnerable

While mechanically allowed, this scenario creates **massive political exposure**:


> **Note**
> **Vulnerabilities of "Resurrection Rulership"**
>
> - **Delegitimization:** "He's just a puppet! The faction controls everything, not the King!"
> - **Target Identification:** Everyone knows WHO to assassinate to break faction control
> - **Corruption Narrative:** This becomes perfect ammunition for reformers and rival factions
> - **Weak Legitimacy:** "He died once and they crowned him again? He'll die again soon."
> - **Chronicle Tracking:** Public records show "Third coronation of [Player Name]" — pattern becomes obvious
> - **Internal Fracture Risk:** Faction members may question why they're serving the same person again


### Player Responses to Resurrection Politics

This scenario is **designed to provoke conflict**. Here's how players can respond:


| Response Type | Method | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Public Challenge | Declare the King a faction puppet, demand reform | Damages legitimacy, rallies opposition |
| Targeted Assassination | Kill the "resurrected" King again to prove pattern | If successful, undermines faction's ability to protect their chosen leader |
| Counter-Faction | Form rival faction with different values ("Merit over dynasties") | Creates institutional competition |
| Internal Subversion | Recruit disgruntled faction members tired of serving same person | Fractures the power base from within |
| Chronicle Weaponization | Point to public death records showing repeated resurrections | Makes pattern undeniable, fuels reform movements |
| Reformer Campaign | Run for King as a claimant promising "real change, not puppet kings" | Offers alternative legitimacy narrative |


### Historical Parallels: Dynastic Resilience

This scenario mirrors real historical patterns:


> **Note**
> **The Medici Returns (15th-16th Century)**
>
> The Medici family was expelled from Florence **twice** (1494 and 1527), yet returned to power both times because their institutional network (banking, church connections, noble alliances) remained intact. Individual Medicis died or were exiled, but the **family/faction** reconsolidated power.
> Opponents called them puppet masters and tyrants — yet they kept winning because their organizational control was real.


> **Note**
> **The Restoration Monarchies**
>
> English monarchy was abolished in 1649 (Charles I beheaded). In 1660, **his son** Charles II was restored to the throne. Same dynasty, different person. Why? The institutional support (nobility, church, military) never fully shifted. The **system** wanted monarchy back.
> This wasn't "resurrection" — it was institutional resilience.


> **Note**
> **Soviet Nomenklatura**
>
> Individual Soviet leaders died (Stalin 1953, Khrushchev ousted 1964, Brezhnev died 1982), but the **same institutional network** (party members, KGB, military officers) controlled succession. Different faces, same power structure. The **organization** outlived individuals.

In all cases: **Individuals died. Institutions survived. Power persisted.**


### When Does This Become a Problem?

This scenario only becomes problematic if **players stop responding to it**. If:


- No one assassinates the "resurrected" King
- No one forms rival factions
- No one challenges faction dominance
- No one weaponizes the Chronicle against them

Then the faction **earned** that dominance through player inaction. The system didn't fail — the opposition did.


> **❗ Note**


### The Chronicle Solution

The public **Chronicle** (death records, coronation records, succession records) makes this pattern **impossible to hide**:


- "King [Character Name A] died [Date], cause: [assassination/combat/execution]"
- "Coronation: [Character Name B] crowned [Date] — [Player Name: same as deceased King]"
- "Coronation: [Character Name C] crowned [Date] — [Player Name: third coronation]"

This ensures:


- Transparency: Everyone knows the pattern
- Accountability: The faction can't deny it
- Ammunition: Opposition has documented proof for propaganda
- Drama: The pattern becomes a narrative hook for conflict


### Summary: Resurrection Politics as Working Gameplay


> Same player, different character, repeated power = Faction dynastic controlThis is:✅ Mechanically allowed (sequential, not simultaneous)✅ Philosophically consistent (tests institutional resilience)✅ Historically accurate (dynasties and factions persisted through individual deaths)✅ Politically vulnerable (creates legitimate challenge opportunities)✅ Dramatically rich (provokes reform movements, assassinations, coups)The question is not "Should this be prevented?"The question is "Why haven't you stopped them yet?"


## Building Power Outside Britain

Claimants usually (though not exclusively) build their base of power **outside of Britain city proper**. This is exactly what makes them so dangerous — they're able to organize in secret, right under the King's nose, and eventually make an attempt on the throne.

This is why claimant strategy is deeply relevant to the [[Guild System|Guilds]] and [[Faction System|Emergent-Factions]]. Claimants build their power base through guilds (the sovereign organizational structure), and their guild may also align with a faction (a voluntary identity layer on top of guilds). Eventually they attempt to take (or fail to take) the throne.

**But here's the twist:** They don't always stay outside. A successful Claimant might **first secure a court position** (Marshal, Magistrate, Regent) while **simultaneously leading a guild that is aligned with a faction**. This gives them both internal legitimacy and external power — the perfect combination for a successful coup.


### Why Outside Bases Were Common


#### 1. Exile = Safety + Freedom to Organize

If you stayed inside the contested territory, you risked arrest, assassination, or being politically boxed in. Outside Britain's walls, you could:


- Raise troops
- Gather money
- Build alliances
- Plan without constant surveillance

**Exile wasn't weakness — it was often a strategic reset.**


#### 2. Foreign Legitimacy and Resources

External powers (factions, guilds, outlying settlements) could provide:


- Armies
- Ships
- Funding
- Diplomatic recognition

That recognition alone could flip internal loyalties once the claimant returned.


#### 3. Distance Creates Mystique

Being absent sometimes helped. Claimants could:


- Avoid blame for current suffering
- Be idealized as a "rightful ruler"
- Let dissatisfaction inside the territory ripen on its own


### Historical Examples


> **Note**
> **Henry Tudor (Henry VII, England)**
>
> - Built his power base in Brittany and France
> - Returned with foreign troops
> - Won at Bosworth (1485) and took the crown


> **Note**
> **William the Conqueror**
>
> - Duke of Normandy, not England
> - Used continental power, ships, and alliances
> - Invaded and claimed England in 1066


> **Note**
> **Napoleon Bonaparte**
>
> - His early power base was the army, not Parisian politics
> - Foreign campaigns (Italy, Egypt) created prestige
> - Returned as a "savior" figure


> **Note**
> **Lenin**
>
> - Built revolutionary networks largely in exile
> - Returned when the internal situation collapsed enough to allow a takeover


> **❗ Note**


## How Claimants Challenge Succession

Claimants have several strategies to claim the Crown:


### 1. Race to Coronation

The simplest path: **get to the coronation site first** and crown yourself before the Heir or other rivals.


- **Risk:** The Regent or Heir may block access to the coronation
- **Risk:** Being crowned without legitimacy may trigger civil war
- **Reward:** If successful, you become King — even if contested


> **❗ Note**


### 2. Assassinate the Heir

If the official Heir is killed, their claim is **voided**. This clears the path for Claimants to:


- Step up as the next strongest claim
- Race to coronation without opposition
- Negotiate with the Regent for support


### 3. Build Alliances

Claimants can gain support by:


- **Negotiating with the Regent:** "Support my claim, and I'll keep you in power"
- **Recruiting noble houses:** Gain vassal loyalty through promises of land, titles, or wealth
- **Public declarations:** Announce their claim in Discord or in-game, rallying supporters


### 4. Military Uprising

If diplomatic paths fail, Claimants may:


- Raise armies to challenge the Heir or Regent
- Siege the coronation site to claim the Crown by force
- Start a civil war to contest succession


> Historical Parallel:This mirrors real-world succession conflicts like the Wars of the Roses, where rival claimants (Lancaster vs. York) fought for decades over who had the rightful claim to the English throne.


### 5. Delegitimize the Heir

Claimants may use **political warfare** to undermine the Heir's legitimacy:


- "The previous King was a tyrant — his appointed Heir has no right to rule"
- "The Heir is not of true blood — I am the rightful descendant"
- "The Heir is weak and unfit — I am the stronger candidate"


## The Claimant's Gamble

Being a Claimant is **extremely risky**:


### ✅ If You Win:


- You become King/Queen and hold the Crown
- Your claim is retroactively legitimized by victory
- You gain control over the entire realm


### ❌ If You Lose:


- You may be executed as a **traitor or rebel**
- Your lands and titles may be seized
- You lose all political standing and become an outlaw
- Your house may be dishonored


> **❗ Note**


## Defending Against Claimants

If you are the **Heir** or **Regent**, you must deal with Claimants:


### As the Heir:


- **Crown yourself quickly:** The faster you complete coronation, the less time Claimants have to act
- **Secure alliances:** Rally noble houses and the Regent (if possible) to your side
- **Bodyguards & protection:** Claimants may assassinate you — stay vigilant
- **Delegitimize Claimants:** Publicly denounce them as traitors or pretenders


### As the Regent:


- **Support the Heir:** Crush Claimants militarily or politically
- **Negotiate with Claimants:** Offer them lesser titles to stand down
- **Self-crown:** If Claimants threaten stability, the Regent may seize the throne themselves
- **Execute Claimants:** Use Regent authority to imprison or eliminate rivals


## Types of Claims

Not all claims are equal. The **strength of a claim** affects how much political support a Claimant receives:


### 1. Strong Claims


- **Direct lineage:** Child or sibling of the previous King
- **Historical dynasty:** Descendant of a past ruling family
- **Popular support:** Widely loved or respected by the realm

*Strong claims gain more allies and legitimacy faster.*


### 2. Weak Claims


- **Distant relatives:** Cousins, distant lineage, or vague connections
- **Manufactured claims:** "I bought this title" or "I won a contest"
- **No lineage:** Pure merit or conquest-based claims

*Weak claims require more force, politics, or cunning to succeed.*


### 3. Fabricated Claims


- **False lineage:** Claiming heritage that doesn't exist
- **Forged documents:** Creating fake evidence of royal descent
- **Opportunistic claims:** "I found a crown, so I'm King now"

*Fabricated claims are the weakest and most likely to be rejected or crushed.*


## Multiple Claimants: The Chaos Scenario

When **multiple Claimants** emerge simultaneously, the realm descends into chaos:


- Each Claimant races to coronation
- Alliances form and break rapidly
- Civil war may erupt as factions back different claimants
- The Regent (if any) must choose which claimant to support — or crush them all


> **Note**
> **War of Many Crowns**
>
> This scenario mirrors real-world **succession wars** where multiple factions vie for the throne. Think of the **Wars of the Roses** or the **Sengoku period** in Japan — endless conflict until one victor emerges.


## Historical Parallels

Claimant conflicts are rooted in real history:


- **Wars of the Roses (England, 1455-1487):** Lancaster vs. York, two royal houses with competing claims
- **Henry VII (England, 1485):** A weak claimant who won the throne through military victory at Bosworth Field
- **The Anarchy (England, 1135-1153):** Matilda vs. Stephen, a 19-year civil war over who had the rightful claim
- **Sengoku Period (Japan, 1467-1615):** Countless warlords claiming the right to rule, leading to decades of war
