# Editing Rules for Kingdoms of Britannia Wiki

This document contains the core principle for editing the wiki to ensure consistency, maintainability, and prevent information conflicts.

## Single Source of Truth

**Try to keep information about something on a single page.**

- **Example:** The `Roles` page should contain a **general overview** about each role, but `Steward` will contain **ALL specific information** about the Steward role.
- **Rationale:** If a general page contains too much information about a specific topic, that topic should be contained in its own specific page. This prevents conflicting points of information throughout the wiki.
- **Result:** Information should be **incredibly modular**.

### When Editing

- Before adding detailed information to a general/overview page, ask: "Does this topic have its own dedicated page?"
- If yes → Link to that page instead of duplicating content
- If no, but the content is substantial → Consider creating a dedicated page
- Keep overview pages focused on summaries and navigation
- Keep specific pages focused on exhaustive detail

### Cross-Referencing

- When mentioning a topic that has its own page, link to it using wiki-style syntax: `[[Page Name]]`
- Include "See [[Page Name]] for complete details" when referencing comprehensive information elsewhere
- Maintain clear navigation between related topics

**Before Making Changes:**

1. Am I creating duplicate information that exists elsewhere?
2. Does this change maintain the single source of truth principle?
3. Should this be its own page, or does it belong on an existing page?
