# ⚔️ Unofficial Roles

*Self-Titled Professions in a World with Consequences*

## What Are Unofficial Roles?

In most Ultima Online servers, certain professions simply cannot exist meaningfully. Without permadeath, without political systems that matter, without economic pressure that creates real demand—these roles become hollow roleplay at best.

On Kingdoms of Britannia, permadeath changes everything. Political intrigue has teeth. Economic failure has consequences. Violence has permanence. And because of this, an entire ecosystem of **unofficial roles** emerges—professions that players claim for themselves without anyone's permission.

> **Core Principle:**
>
> "You don't need a decree to become an assassin. You just need clients, targets, and the skill to survive."

These roles are **self-titled**. No official appointment. No ceremony. No ledger entry. You claim the profession, you build your reputation, and the world reacts accordingly. Some of these professions have mechanical support. Most do not—and that's by design. Your reputation is your credential.

## Hired Blade

*Game of Thrones Equivalent: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater*

The Hired Blade is a fighter-for-hire, a sellsword who takes contracts for gold. Unlike organized mercenaries, a Hired Blade operates independently or in small crews. They are:

- **Duelists for hire:** Settle disputes through trial by combat
- **Enforcers:** Intimidate rivals, collect debts, deliver messages with muscle
- **Bodyguards:** Protect a client during dangerous travel or political meetings
- **Problem solvers:** Handle "delicate situations" that clients can't address openly

**Why This Role Exists:** Permadeath makes violence meaningful. A King who fears assassination needs protection. A merchant who owes gold needs enforcement. A noble who faces a trial by combat needs a champion. The Hired Blade fills those gaps—for the right price.

**No Mechanics Required:** This is pure player-to-player interaction. Contracts are verbal or written agreements. Payment is negotiated. Success or failure is determined by skill.

## Assassin

The Assassin is the dark mirror of the Hired Blade—a killer who operates from the shadows, taking contracts to eliminate specific targets permanently.

Assassins exist because permadeath creates demand:
- A rival claimant wants the King dead before coronation
- A guild leader wants a troublesome member removed quietly
- A faction wants a Crown official eliminated to destabilize Britain
- A merchant wants a competitor removed from the market

**The Black Market Bounty System:** Unlike the official [[Crown Bounty System|Bounty]], assassins operate under the table. Contracts are made privately. Payment is off the books. Success is measured by whether the target dies—and whether the assassin survives to collect.

**Risk and Reward:**
- If caught, assassins face [[execution|Execution-Mechanics]]
- If successful, they gain gold, reputation, and future clients
- If they fail, they may be hunted by guards, the target's allies, or rival assassins

> **Political Fallout:**
>
> Assassinations don't just kill individuals—they destabilize governments. A successful hit on a King triggers [[succession crises|Succession]]. A dead noble creates power vacuums. The ripple effects make assassination a political tool, not just murder.

## Mercenaries (Organized)

When faction-vs-Crown-vs-guild diplomacy breaks down, organized mercenaries step in to rebalance the scales. Unlike Hired Blades who work solo, mercenary companies operate as guilds or factions—offering military services to the highest bidder.

### What Mercenary Companies Provide

- **Military force:** Provide troops for sieges, raids, or defensive contracts
- **Training:** Teach combat skills to guild members or faction soldiers
- **Strategic counsel:** Advise clients on military tactics and political maneuvering
- **Neutrality (for a price):** Remain uncommitted until paid, allowing smaller factions to punch above their weight

### Why Mercenaries Matter

In a world where [[Britain's Military|Military]] can refuse orders, where [[Guards]] may side with factions over the Crown, and where guilds rise and fall based on political maneuvering—mercenaries provide a predictable, purchasable solution. They fight for gold, not ideology.

**Example Scenario:**
- A small faction is under threat from a larger rival
- They hire a mercenary company for 50,000 gold
- The mercenaries provide 20 skilled fighters for 2 weeks
- The faction survives, the mercenaries get paid, and the balance of power shifts

Mercenaries are especially valuable to factions that are **Outlawed** or **Tolerated** under the [[Crown's recognition system|Crown-Recognition]]—they can't rely on Britain's protection, so they buy it.

## Escort / Bodyguard

Like mercenaries but at a smaller, more personal scale. Escorts and bodyguards sell protection—not for armies, but for individuals traveling dangerous roads, attending hostile meetings, or moving valuable cargo.

### Services Offered

- **Travel protection:** Guard merchants transporting goods between cities or faction territories
- **Event security:** Protect nobles during public ceremonies, trials, or political gatherings
- **VIP escort:** Accompany high-value targets (Kings, heirs, diplomats) through hostile areas
- **Courier security:** Ensure sensitive messages or items reach their destination

**Why This Role Exists:** Permadeath makes travel risky. A merchant carrying 100,000 gold in trade goods doesn't want to travel alone. A diplomat negotiating with an Outlawed faction needs muscle. A claimant gathering support in faction territories needs protection from assassins.

Bodyguards trade on reputation. A single failed contract—where the client dies—can destroy credibility. Success builds trust and commands higher prices.

## Bounty Hunter

Bounty hunters pursue Crown-issued bounties through the official [[Bounty System|Bounty]]. Unlike assassins who work in the shadows, bounty hunters operate within the law—capturing or killing targets with legal authorization.

### How Bounty Hunters Operate

- **Track targets:** Use rumors, informants, and observation to locate wanted individuals
- **Choose capture or kill:** Some bounties reward capture; others pay for confirmed death
- **Deliver proof:** Bring the target to guards or present evidence of elimination
- **Collect payment:** Receive gold mechanically through the bounty system

### Why Bounty Hunters Matter

Not all criminals stay in Britain's jurisdiction. Outlawed factions harbor fugitives. Exiled nobles flee to rival territories. The Crown can issue bounties, but [[Guards]] may lack the reach—or the will—to pursue them. Bounty hunters fill that gap.

> **Legal Gray Area:**
>
> Bounty hunters often operate outside social norms. They may:
> - Enter faction territory without permission
> - Use deception, bribery, or intimidation to locate targets
> - Kill targets in public, claiming legal immunity under the bounty
>
> This makes them effective—but not necessarily popular.

**Anyone can become a bounty hunter.** There's no appointment, no official role. You see a bounty. You pursue it. You collect or you die trying.

## Merchant and Shopkeep

In-game shop ownership is real. [[Guilds]] and [[factions|Emergent-Factions]] control properties and place [[player-run vendors|Player-Controlled-Vendors]]. A marketplace can form when multiple buildings cluster together—creating organic economic hubs.

### Examples of Player-Driven Commerce

- **Blacksmith Guilds:** Operate weapon and armor shops within city walls
- **Faction Marketplaces:** Control multiple buildings and create a defacto player marketplace
- **Traveling Merchants:** Move goods between cities, buying low and selling high
- **Specialty Craftsmen:** Focus on rare or high-demand goods (legendary weapons, rare reagents, custom armor)

### Why Merchants Matter

Merchants aren't just vendors—they're economic engines. They:
- Generate [[tax revenue|Guild-Faction-Economy]] for guilds and factions
- Attract foot traffic to faction territories
- Create dependencies (if one guild monopolizes a critical resource, they gain political leverage)
- Fund wars, upkeep, and expansion through commerce

A successful merchant can become wealthier and more influential than many nobles—without ever holding an official title.

## Farmer

Many [[homes and plots of land|Housing]] come with fertile ground. Farmers cultivate crops, raise livestock, and supply food to cities, guilds, and factions.

**Why Farming Exists as a Profession:**
- Food may be required for upkeep or faction sustenance (server-dependent)
- Crops can be sold to provisioners or used in alchemy and cooking
- Control over food supply creates economic leverage
- Farmland ownership ties players to territories and faction politics

Farmers are often overlooked—until a siege cuts off food supplies and cities begin to starve. Then, farmers become strategic assets.

## Public Prosecutor (Non-Crown)

With a functioning [[justice system|Jail]], players may need advocates to argue their defense—or to prosecute accused criminals. The Crown has its own legal apparatus, but unofficial prosecutors operate outside royal authority.

### What Public Prosecutors Do

- **Argue cases:** Present evidence, question witnesses, and advocate for clients during trials
- **Negotiate plea deals:** Work with guards, magistrates, or the Crown to reduce sentences
- **Contest unjust arrests:** Challenge the legal basis of [[arrests|Arrest-Records]] or [[executions|Execution-Mechanics]]
- **Represent factions:** Defend faction members accused of crimes against the Crown

**Why This Role Matters:** Not everyone charged with a crime is guilty. Not every execution is just. Prosecutors provide a social (and sometimes political) counterweight to Crown authority. A skilled prosecutor can save lives, expose corruption, or delay politically motivated trials long enough for allies to intervene.

## Status Roles: Casualties of Regime Change

*When a New King Clears the Court*

These aren't quite professions—they're **political situations made visible**. When a new king takes the throne, one of the first acts is often to clear the cabinet of advisors. The previous regime's leadership is ousted, exiled, or stripped of authority. What happens to those people?

They don't simply disappear. They become living reminders that power is temporary, legitimacy is contested, and every regime creates casualties. These status roles represent **the aftermath of political transitions**—the nobles who bet on the wrong heir, the knights who served a deposed king, the illegitimate children whose claims suddenly matter when succession is in doubt.

> ### Why These Roles Exist
>
> In a world with permadeath and contested succession, **regime change creates human wreckage**. These roles give players a way to embody that wreckage—to be proof that the new order isn't clean, that the previous regime had supporters, and that exiling someone doesn't erase them.
>
> They're not jobs. They're **consequences with names**.

## Disgraced Noble

*Status • Self-Claim (with constraints)*

You were someone. You held rank, influence, maybe even a seat at the King's table. And then—through betrayal, scandal, political miscalculation, or simply backing the wrong heir—you lost it all.

Now you exist in a liminal space: too prominent to ignore, too tainted to trust. You are a **living accusation** that the system failed you—or that you failed the system. Which story people believe determines whether you're a martyr or a warning.

### How You Become Disgraced

- **Cabinet Purge:** A new king takes the throne and clears out the previous regime's advisors. You're ousted publicly, your titles stripped, your property seized. You're left with your name and your grievances.
- **Failed Coup:** You backed a claimant who lost. You weren't executed—that would make you a martyr. Instead, you were exiled or publicly shamed. Now you wander Britain as proof that challenging the Crown has consequences.
- **Scandal or Denouncement:** The King or Magistrate publicly declared you unfit—corrupt, treasonous, incompetent. True or not, the stain remains. Your reputation is your punishment.
- **Self-Imposed Exile:** You resigned or fled before you could be removed, but everyone knows why. The title "Disgraced" follows you because silence is admission.

### What You Represent

You are proof that legitimacy is not absolute. Every time you appear in public, you remind people:
- **Power is temporary** — The same Crown that elevated you destroyed you
- **Justice is political** — Were you guilty, or just inconvenient?
- **The system has casualties** — Not everyone who loses dies. Some are left to rot in public.

### Your Motivations

What do you want now?
- **Redemption:** Prove you were wronged. Rebuild your reputation. Serve the new regime so loyally that they restore your honor—or at least forget your disgrace.
- **Revenge:** The Crown destroyed you. You will destroy the Crown. Whether through assassination, supporting rival claimants, or exposing hypocrisy—you will see them fall.
- **Survival:** You just want to live. Maybe work as a courtier for a guild, offer your expertise quietly, fade into obscurity. But Britain won't let you forget.
- **Exposure of Hypocrisy:** You know the truth. You were there when the deals were made, the oaths were broken, the bodies were buried. Now you're free to speak—and that makes you dangerous.

### Mechanical Constraints

- **Requires previously held Noble seat OR public denouncement by King/Magistrate** — You can't claim disgrace without having had honor first
- **Cannot hold any Britain office seat simultaneously** — Disgrace and official power are mutually exclusive

### Natural Conflicts

- **The Crown:** You're a reminder of their ruthlessness—or their weakness. Either way, they'd prefer you gone.
- **The Magistrate:** If they declared you guilty, your continued existence questions their judgment. If they didn't, you're proof the Crown acts without law.
- **Minax:** You're vulnerable, angry, and politically experienced. You're exactly who Minax recruits. Resisting that is its own struggle.
- **Public Sympathy:** Some see you as a victim. Others see you as a traitor. Both create pressure.

### Player Fantasy

**"You are proof the system is not perfect."**

You get to embody the human cost of political power. Every trial you attend, every decree you witness, you're a living counterpoint. You represent the question: "Was it worth it?"

## Exiled Knight

*Status • Self-Claim*

You were trained to serve. To protect. To embody honor through martial skill. And then the regime you served fell, or betrayed you, or simply decided you were expendable. Now you're a knight without a king.

You still have your skills. Your discipline. Your code—whatever's left of it. But you no longer have authority, protection, or purpose. You are **martial power without legitimacy**.

### How You Become Exiled

- **Regime Change:** You served the previous king. When he died or was deposed, the new king didn't want you. You were too loyal to the old order, too dangerous to keep, too visible to quietly retire. So you were exiled.
- **Failure of Duty:** You failed to protect someone important. Or you succeeded in protecting someone the Crown wanted dead. Either way, you were cast out—formally or through social pressure.
- **Moral Stand:** You refused an order. Maybe the Crown commanded something dishonorable—an execution without trial, an attack on civilians, a betrayal of an oath. You said no. And for that, you were exiled.
- **Political Purge:** You weren't guilty of anything except being associated with the wrong faction. When that faction fell, so did you.

### What You Represent

You are **competence without allegiance**. You're dangerous because:
- You're skilled in violence but no longer bound by law
- You understand how guards think, how castles are defended, how power protects itself
- You're motivated by survival, honor, or revenge—none of which require you to serve the Crown

### Your Paths Forward

What does an exiled knight do?
- **Sell Your Sword:** Work as a mercenary, bodyguard, or enforcer. Your skills are valuable. Your loyalty is negotiable.
- **Serve Honor Over Law:** Protect the weak, hunt criminals the Crown ignores, become a vigilante. You don't need permission to do what's right.
- **Test Virtue:** Challenge the new regime to prove itself worthy. If they're just, they'll welcome your service. If they're corrupt, you'll expose them.
- **Fade Into Obscurity:** Retire to a quiet life. Train others. Try to forget. But Britain doesn't let warriors rest easily.
- **Seek Redemption or Revenge:** Return to favor by proving your worth—or destroy those who exiled you.

### Mechanical Constraints

- **Cannot hold any Britain office simultaneously** — Exile and official service are incompatible
- **Optional: Requires "Knight" background or previously held knight role** — Server-dependent enforcement

### Natural Conflicts

- **The Guard:** You're a reminder that loyalty can be punished. Some guards sympathize. Others see you as a threat.
- **The Crown:** You're too skilled to ignore, too resentful to trust. They want you controlled or gone.
- **Factions:** You're a free agent with military expertise. Everyone wants to recruit you. Refusing creates enemies.
- **Your Own Code:** What does honor mean when the system that knighted you is gone?

### Player Fantasy

**"You are a weapon without a master."**

You get to explore what happens when duty and honor diverge from law and authority. You're respected and feared, but never fully trusted. You're proof that skill and loyalty aren't enough—politics always wins.

## Bastard of the Realm

*Status • Self-Claim or Declared*

You are the child of someone important—a king, a noble, a claimant—but you were born outside legitimacy. You have blood without right, claim without recognition. You exist in the space between "nobody" and "heir."

Most of the time, you're invisible. But during succession crises, you become **politically combustible**.

### How You Become a Bastard of the Realm

- **Parentage:** Someone important is your parent—acknowledged or suspected. Maybe the previous king. Maybe a claimant. Maybe a noble whose legitimate heirs all died.
- **Public Declaration:** Someone—your parent, a rival, or yourself—publicly claims your bloodline. True or not, the claim is now political.
- **Succession Pressure:** When legitimate heirs are scarce, suddenly bastards matter. You're called forward not because anyone wants you, but because the alternatives are worse.

### What You Represent

You are **contingency made flesh**. As long as legitimate succession is stable, you're a footnote. But the moment succession is contested, you become:
- A potential claimant—maybe weaker than legitimate heirs, but still dangerous
- A bargaining chip—factions use you to pressure the Crown or rivals
- A target—legitimate heirs may want you dead to simplify succession
- A wildcard—your very existence destabilizes clean narratives

### Your Strategic Value

What makes you dangerous isn't your claim—it's your **leverage**:
- **Hidden Legitimacy:** If the legitimate heir is weak, unpopular, or contested, factions may back you as an alternative
- **Symbolic Power:** You can publicly support or oppose claimants, lending (or denying) legitimacy through your bloodline
- **Scandal Potential:** Your existence is proof of someone's indiscretion. That information is valuable.
- **Succession Insurance:** If all legitimate heirs die, you're the last option before civil war

### Your Motivations

- **Claim the Throne:** Why should an accident of birth deny you power? You have the blood. You'll take the Crown.
- **Seek Recognition:** You don't want to rule—you just want acknowledgment. A title, a pardon, an apology.
- **Survive:** Being a bastard makes you a target. Stay quiet, stay safe, hope succession resolves without your involvement.
- **Exploit the Situation:** You're politically valuable. Sell your support, make deals, extract concessions. You may not get the Crown, but you'll get something.
- **Reject It All:** You didn't ask for this bloodline. You want nothing to do with succession. But Britain won't let you opt out.

### Mechanical Constraints

- **Self-Claim or Declared** — You can claim this status, or someone else (King, parent, rival) can declare it for you
- **No mechanical power by default** — Your influence is entirely social and political

### Natural Conflicts

- **Legitimate Heirs:** You're a threat to their claim. They want you discredited, exiled, or dead.
- **The Crown:** If you're challenging legitimacy, you're a problem. If you're supporting it, you're useful. Either way, you're temporary.
- **Factions:** You're a potential puppet king. Everyone wants to control you.
- **Public Opinion:** Some see you as tragic. Others see you as grasping. Both put pressure on the Crown's response to you.

### Player Fantasy

**"You are the claim that shouldn't exist—but does."**

You get to play the character who throws succession into chaos just by being alive. You're not powerful enough to win outright, but you're too dangerous to ignore. Every interaction is a negotiation. Every public appearance is political.

## Courtier

*Status • Multiple • Self-Claim or Social Recognition*

The Courtier is power without a title—influence without appointment. They inhabit the space between commoner and noble, between outsider and insider, shaping decisions through proximity, gossip, and social maneuvering rather than formal authority.

### What Courtiers Represent

Courtiers can represent:
- **A Guild:** Advocating for guild interests at court, negotiating favorable terms, warning of Crown policies that harm their organization
- **A Faction:** Acting as an unofficial voice for an outlawed or tolerated faction, building relationships that protect their people
- **Themselves:** Operating independently, accumulating favors and leverage without formal allegiance

Some courtiers serve one master loyally. Others play all sides. The best courtiers make everyone believe they're on their side.

### Why Courtiers Exist

Courtiers exist because **proximity to the Crown equals power**. The closer you are to the King, the Regent, the Marshal, or the High Emissary, the more you can:
- **Shape policies before they're declared:** A whispered suggestion in the King's ear becomes tomorrow's decree
- **Intercept information before it spreads:** Knowing what's coming gives factions time to prepare, hide, or strike first
- **Protect allies and harm rivals:** A courtier can warn friends of coming arrests or ensure enemies are "mentioned" during council meetings
- **Accumulate social capital:** Every favor owed, every secret known, every connection made increases their value and safety

Courtiers don't pull the lever—they decide who does.

### How Courtiers Operate

Unlike official roles, courtiers have no mechanical powers. Their influence is entirely social and reputational. They operate through:

#### Social Jousting

Court is a battlefield where words replace swords. Courtiers compete to remain **socially and influentially relevant** because the moment they're ignored, they lose everything. This means:
- **Public wit and charm:** Being memorable, quotable, entertaining—making sure people seek your company
- **Strategic flattery:** Praising the right people at the right time without appearing sycophantic
- **Controlled leaks:** Revealing information selectively to prove you're "in the know"
- **Social triangulation:** Connecting rivals to manufacture conflicts that benefit you

#### Gossip as Currency

Courtiers trade in information. They:
- Overhear conversations between nobles
- Observe who meets privately and what happens afterward
- Track patterns: who's gaining favor, who's falling out, who's desperate
- Spread rumors—sometimes true, sometimes strategic lies—that shape perception

A skilled courtier knows more than the [[Master of Whispers|Roles]]—they just don't have official sanction.

#### Connecting Factions

Courtiers serve as informal intermediaries between:
- The Crown and outlawed factions (back-channel negotiations that can't be official)
- Rival guilds who need to cooperate but can't be seen meeting directly
- Foreign powers and Britain (facilitating trade or diplomacy without official [[Envoys|Envoy]])

When official channels fail or can't be used, courtiers fill the gap—for a price.

### Courtiers vs Official Roles

> ### Why Not Just Appoint Them?
>
> Official advisors like the **Chancellor** or **Chamberlain** (see [[Official Roles|Roles]]) serve at the King's pleasure and carry formal authority. Courtiers exist *outside* that system, which makes them:
> - **Deniable:** The Crown can disavow their actions if needed
> - **Flexible:** They can advocate for ideas the King can't publicly support
> - **Dangerous:** Their loyalty is social, not structural—it can shift
>
> A courtier representing a guild serves that guild first, the Crown second. An official advisor serves the Crown—supposedly.

### Motivations

- **Gain favor:** Accumulate social capital with the Crown, nobles, and factions
- **Stay relevant:** Remain visible, valuable, and "in the room" when decisions are made
- **Avoid blame:** Never be the one holding the knife when things go wrong
- **Climb quietly:** Position yourself for appointment to official roles—or make yourself so valuable you don't need them
- **Shape the world:** Use proximity to the Crown to bend policy toward your worldview, guild interests, or faction survival

### Responsibilities (Self-Imposed)

- **Advise:** Offer counsel to nobles, even if they don't ask for it
- **Gossip:** Spread information (true or false) that benefits your position
- **Connect factions:** Broker introductions, negotiations, and alliances
- **Attend everything:** Trials, coronations, executions, public decrees—visibility equals relevance
- **Read the room:** Sense shifts in power and adjust allegiances before it's too late

### Natural Conflicts

**Everyone. Especially each other.**

Courtiers compete for the same social space, the same access, the same ears. This creates:
- **Rival courtiers:** Undercutting each other's credibility, spreading counter-gossip, stealing credit
- **Official advisors:** Resenting courtiers who bypass formal channels
- **Guards and Military:** Viewing courtiers as manipulative parasites who whisper while soldiers fight
- **Factions:** Suspicious that courtiers claiming to represent them are actually double agents
- **The Crown:** Useful until they become too influential—then they're threats

### Player Fantasy

**"You never pull the lever—you decide who does."**

Courtiers get:
- Access to spaces where decisions are made
- The thrill of social combat—wit, timing, and charisma as weapons
- The ability to protect allies and destroy enemies without violence
- The satisfaction of watching your whispered suggestion become tomorrow's decree
- The risk of being caught in the fallout when your schemes collapse

### How to Play a Courtier

1. **Be present:** Attend every public event. Trials, coronations, decrees, executions—if nobles are there, you're there.
2. **Listen more than you speak:** Gather information before you spend it.
3. **Make yourself useful:** Connect people who need each other. Offer information that solves someone's problem.
4. **Choose your allegiance carefully:** Representing a guild or faction gives you backing—but also limits your flexibility.
5. **Never be the most powerful person in the room:** Courtiers survive by being *adjacent* to power, not holding it directly.
6. **Know when to shift allegiances:** Courtiers who stay loyal to falling regimes fall with them.

> **Warning:**
>
> Courtiers live and die by reputation. One exposed lie, one failed scheme, one betrayal too many—and you're exiled from court. No one will meet with you. No one will trust you. And no title or decree can restore that.

## Warden

*Self-Claim • Guards with Jail Access*

You watch the prisoners. You keep the cells. You decide whether a jailed criminal sits in silence or faces constant psychological pressure. You are the atmosphere of captivity.

The [[Jail|Jail]] operates mechanically without you—arrests happen, timers run, releases occur. But you make custody *feel* real. A prisoner sitting alone in a cell is just waiting. A prisoner being interrogated, mocked, or given false hope by a Warden is *experiencing consequences*.

### What Wardens Do

- **Create jail atmosphere:** Visit prisoners, ask questions, deliver messages from the outside world (or lie about them)
- **Psychological pressure:** Make custody uncomfortable through conversation, implied threats, or strategic silence
- **Observe and report:** Notice patterns—who gets arrested repeatedly, who visits prisoners, who gets released suspiciously fast
- **Control access socially:** You can't mechanically block visits, but you can make visitors uncomfortable or extract information from them

### Why This Role Exists

Guards have jail access by default. Any guard can choose to focus on prisoners rather than patrols. Some guards enjoy the interrogation, the long conversations, the psychological game. Others find it tedious and leave it to those who specialize.

You're not appointed. You're not required. You're just the guard who decided to make prisoners your focus. And prisoners remember you.

### Natural Conflicts

- **Prisoners and their allies:** You're the face of their captivity. When they're released, you may become a target.
- **Other guards:** Some see you as wasting time on captured criminals instead of hunting new ones.
- **The Crown:** If you let prisoners escape or provide them with information, you're a liability.

### Player Fantasy

**"You are the voice in the dark."**

You get to explore the psychological side of captivity. You're not the one who arrested them. You're not the one who sentenced them. But you're the one they see every day. You're the one who decides whether their time in jail is quiet waiting or constant dread.

## Coroner

*Self-Claim • Forensic Investigation Specialist*

You examine corpses. You determine cause of death. You piece together what happened from the evidence left behind. The better your [[forensic evaluation|Account-Skill-Boosts-Mastery]] skill, the more information you extract from the dead.

There's no official Coroner appointment. Anyone can examine a body. But most people don't bother learning the skill. You did. And because of that, you see what others miss.

### What Coroners Do

- **Examine corpses:** Use forensic evaluation to determine method of death, weapon type, time since death, signs of struggle
- **Investigate deaths:** Gather witness testimony, compare stories to physical evidence, identify inconsistencies
- **Publish findings:** Write reports on deaths that matter—nobles, Crown officials, suspicious custody deaths
- **Advise Magistrates:** Provide evidence for trials when murder charges are filed

### Why This Role Exists

Permadeath makes every death matter. When someone important dies, people want answers. Guards might not care. The Crown might not investigate. But you do—either because you're paid, because you're curious, or because you want to expose the truth.

**Skill-based information:** A novice examines a corpse and learns "killed by blade." An expert learns "killed by a single precise strike to the heart, executed by someone with professional training, likely a guard or knight, death occurred 4-6 hours ago."

The higher your forensic evaluation skill, the more the game reveals. Investigation quality scales with player investment.

### Natural Conflicts

- **Killers:** You're the person who can connect evidence to suspects. Assassins want you gone.
- **The Crown:** If your investigations reveal inconvenient truths about guard misconduct or political murders, you become a problem.
- **Rival investigators:** Other coroners may reach different conclusions, creating competing narratives.

### Player Fantasy

**"You give the dead a voice."**

You get to solve mysteries. You get to expose lies. You get to stand in a trial and present evidence that names a killer. Or you get to stay silent and profit from what you know. The dead can't speak—but you can speak for them.

## Executioner

*Self-Claim • Guards with Execution Authority*

You carry out executions. When someone is sentenced to death, you're the one who delivers the final blow. You're not appointed by the Crown. You're just the guard who volunteered to be the one who kills.

[[Guards|Guards]] have legal authority to execute prisoners within Britain. This isn't a special role—it's something any guard can do. But most guards don't want to. They prefer patrols, arrests, investigations. So the ones who *do* volunteer become known as "the executioner."

### What Executioners Do

- **Perform executions:** When a death sentence is issued, you deliver the killing blow publicly
- **Absorb blame:** Allies of the executed remember you. You become a target for revenge.
- **Create atmosphere:** Public executions are theater. You decide whether they're solemn, brutal, or ceremonial.
- **Embody finality:** You're the last person the condemned sees. You represent the Crown's final answer to defiance.

### Why This Role Exists

Execution needs a face. Someone has to do it. Someone has to be seen doing it. And that someone will be blamed, feared, and remembered. Most guards avoid this burden. You embrace it—whether for duty, for reputation, or because you don't mind the stigma.

**Guards have the authority.** You don't need special permission. You don't need a formal title. You just need to be the guard standing there when the sentence is read. And you need to be willing to swing the blade.

### Natural Conflicts

- **Allies of the executed:** Every execution creates permanent enemies. They remember your name.
- **Political fallout:** When regimes change, executioners are often the first to be purged or killed as symbolic justice.
- **Other guards:** Some respect you for doing the hard work. Others see you as a butcher hiding behind legal authority.

### Player Fantasy

**"You are the end."**

You get to embody consequence. You get to be the final moment in someone's story. You get to be feared, respected, or hated depending on who you execute and why. You are not subtle. You are not hidden. You are the face of irreversible punishment.

## Guild and Faction Specific Professions

Beyond the professions listed above, guilds and factions will develop their own internal roles to manage their organizations. These roles are entirely player-defined and will vary based on each organization's structure and priorities.

### Examples of Internal Roles

#### Leadership Organization

- **Council Members:** Advisors to the guildmaster or faction leader
- **Succession Planners:** Manage internal succession when leaders die
- **Internal Magistrates:** Resolve disputes between guild members

#### Diplomatic Organization

- **Ambassadors:** Negotiate with other factions, guilds, or the Crown
- **Spies and Informants:** Gather intelligence on rivals
- **Treaty Negotiators:** Draft [[formal agreements|Guild-Interactions]] with other organizations

#### Military Organization

- **Generals and Commanders:** Direct faction military forces during conflicts
- **Trainers:** Teach combat skills to new recruits
- **Scouts:** Survey enemy positions, trade routes, and vulnerabilities

#### Economic Organization

- **Treasurers:** Manage faction/guild [[banking|Guild-Banking]] and [[upkeep|Guild-Upkeep]]
- **Tax Collectors:** Oversee vendor revenue and internal taxation
- **Trade Negotiators:** Establish trade agreements with other guilds or factions
- **Quartermaster:** Manage resource stockpiles, equipment distribution, and supply lines

These roles emerge organically based on need. A small guild may have none of them. A powerful faction may have dozens. The server doesn't enforce these structures—players create them.

## What Will You Become?

This list is not exhaustive. It's a starting point. The professions described here exist because the server's systems—permadeath, political conflict, economic pressure, and player agency—create the conditions for them to matter.

But you're not limited to these roles. As you explore Kingdoms of Britannia, ask yourself:

> ### Questions to Inspire Your Path
>
> - **What niche can you fill?** Is there a service no one else provides? A gap in the market? A need that others overlook?
> - **How do the server's rules create opportunities?** Does permadeath enable a profession that couldn't exist elsewhere? Does the political system create demand for a specific skill?
> - **What reputation do you want to build?** Are you a trusted mediator? A feared enforcer? A cunning spy? A reliable supplier?
> - **Can you create a profession that doesn't exist yet?** What if you became the server's first insurance broker, offering to compensate clients if their goods are stolen? What if you became a professional mediator, resolving disputes between factions for a fee? What if you became a historian, documenting major events and selling your chronicles?

**The server gives you tools. You give them meaning.**

Can *you* think of unique professions that would fit within this world, thanks to changes to the game's fundamental rules, laws, and dynamics? What role will you claim? What reputation will you build? What will you become when the world has real consequences?

> **Final Thought:**

> "In a world where death is permanent, where politics matter, and where every player is writing history—there are no NPCs. Every profession is real. Every choice has weight. And every player is someone's story."
