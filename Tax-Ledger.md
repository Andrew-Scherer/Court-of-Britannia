# 📜 The Tax Ledger

**Revenue, Policy, and the Cost of Rule**

---


## Core Definition

The Tax Ledger is the public record of all city tax policy, revenue intake, and fiscal changes enacted under Crown authority.

It documents what the city takes, when policy changes, and who is responsible — not how individuals should react.

The ledger exists to ensure:


- Transparency without micromanagement
- Accountability without permission-gating
- Continuity regardless of player presence


## What the Tax Ledger Records (Automatic)

The Tax Ledger automatically records:


- Current tax rates by category
- Historical tax rate changes
- Timestamp of each policy change
- Identity of the proposer ([[Master of the Treasury|Master-Treasury]])
- Identity of the authorizing authority ([[King|Becoming-King]] / [[Regent|Regent]] / automatic ratification)
- Daily aggregated revenue totals per category

All entries are system-generated.  

        No manual entries are required to maintain accuracy.


## Tax Categories Tracked

The ledger distinguishes revenue by source, including but not limited to:


### City Sales Tax


- NPC vendors within city walls
- Player vendors operating within city jurisdiction


### Property Transaction Tax


- [[Property|Property]] transfers
- Sales conducted under city authority


### Other City Fees


- System-defined tariffs or civic fees
- [[Bounty|Bounty]] funding inflows (if applicable)

Each category is logged independently to preserve clarity.


## Policy Change Entries

Every tax change produces a formal ledger entry containing:


| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Previous Rate | Tax rate before the change |
| Proposed Rate | Newly proposed tax rate |
| Time Proposal Issued | Timestamp when proposal was created |
| End of Review Window | Timestamp when 24-hour period expires |
| Outcome | Approved by Crown / Modified by Crown / Rejected by Crown / Automatically enacted |

The ledger makes no judgment.  

        It records fact and sequence only.


### Example Entry


## The 24-Hour Ratification Record

For each proposal, the ledger explicitly records whether:


- The Crown acted deliberately
- The Crown modified the proposal
- The Crown rejected the proposal
- The Crown did nothing

Automatic enactment is recorded as such.


> Silence is never invisible.


## Treasury Flow Visibility

The Tax Ledger displays:


- Daily gross revenue
- Category-specific inflow totals
- Comparison against recent historical averages
- Visible correlation to treasury balance changes (referencing the Treasury Ledger)

It does **not**:


- Predict outcomes
- Recommend policy
- Justify decisions

Those functions belong to offices, not records.


## Public Accessibility

The Tax Ledger is:


- Publicly viewable
- Located in the Royal Archives
- Accessible regardless of rank or role

This ensures:


- Citizens can see how the city is funded
- Merchants can observe policy shifts
- [[Guards|Guards]] and officials can understand fiscal pressure
- Political actors can trace cause and effect


## Relationship to Other Ledgers

The Tax Ledger interacts with, but does not replace:


| Ledger | Function |
|---|---|
| Treasury Ledger | Tracks balance and expenditure |
| Salary Ledger | Tracks wage expectations and payments (seeSalary System) |
| Bounty Ledger | Tracks reward funding and payouts |
| Arrest Ledger&Death Ledger | Show consequences of fiscal stress indirectly |

No single ledger tells the whole story.  

        Together, they form institutional memory.


## Offline Continuity Rule

The Tax Ledger functions continuously:


- Taxes apply even if no officials are online
- Revenue accumulates automatically
- Policy windows resolve without intervention

When players return, they respond to recorded outcomes — they do not retroactively approve them.


## Canon Statements


> The Tax Ledger does not judge policy.It records who chose it — and who did not stop it.


> Revenue is automatic.Accountability is permanent.


> A city may survive poor policy.It does not survive invisible policy.


## Design Intent

The Tax Ledger ensures:


- **Taxation is systemic, not personal** — No individual targeting or exemptions
- **Policy is centralized, not discretionary** — Applies uniformly across the city
- **Records outlast rulers** — Fiscal history persists through regime changes
- **Economic pressure is a political force, not a punishment** — Creates conditions, not judgment


## What the Tax Ledger Does Not Do


| Non-Function | Reason |
|---|---|
| Track individual transactions | Preserves privacy; prevents harassment |
| Allow manual adjustments | Prevents corruption and favoritism |
| Provide exemptions | Ensures uniform application |
| Predict future revenue | Not a forecasting tool (that's the Master's function) |
| Enforce collection | Enforcement is automatic and systemic |


## Historical Context

The Tax Ledger preserves:


- Which Crown authorities enacted which policies
- Whether Regency Acts altered tax structure
- Patterns of automatic enactment due to Crown inattention
- Correlation between tax changes and treasury stability

This creates accountability across succession cycles.


## Use Cases (Descriptive, Not Prescriptive)


### For Citizens

Citizens may consult the Tax Ledger to:


- Understand current tax rates before conducting trade
- Observe policy trends over time
- Identify which authority approved changes


### For Merchants

Merchants may use the ledger to:


- Anticipate price adjustments
- Compare rates across time periods
- Correlate policy with trade volume changes


### For Officials

Officials may reference the ledger to:


- Understand revenue constraints
- Trace fiscal stress to specific policy changes
- Hold Crown authority accountable for economic outcomes
