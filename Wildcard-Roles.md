# 🎭 Wildcard Roles

**Flexible King-Appointed Positions with Castle Access**

---


## What Are Wildcard Roles?

The King has the ability to designate a limited number of **Wildcard Roles** — flexible positions that can be customized to serve any purpose the King wishes. Each Wildcard Role comes with a **small private royal apartment in the castle**, granting the holder proximity to power and a physical space within the seat of government.


> **Note**
> **What Makes Wildcard Roles Special**
>
> - **Fully customizable** — The King defines the title, duties, and purpose
> - **Castle access** — Private apartment in the royal castle
> - **Proximity to power** — Legitimizes the holder's presence in court
> - **No predefined duties** — Can be serious or ceremonial
> - **Limited slots** — Scarcity creates competition and value


## Why Wildcard Roles Exist

Not every valuable function fits into predefined offices. Kings need flexibility to:


- Reward loyal supporters with symbolic positions
- Create informal advisory roles without official power
- Accommodate unique player talents (entertainment, advice, protection)
- Experiment with new organizational structures
- Grant castle access to trusted allies

**Wildcard roles are political tools** — they signal who the King trusts, who gets access, and what the King values.


## Example Wildcard Roles


## Other Possible Wildcard Roles


- **Royal Physician** — Medical advisor, herbalist, poisoner (potentially)
- **Court Poet / Chronicler** — Shapes public narrative, controls reputation
- **Master of Whispers** — Spymaster, information broker
- **Keeper of the Royal Library** — Scholarly advisor, historian
- **Master of Ceremonies** — Organizes events, controls protocol
- **Royal Confessor** — Religious advisor, moral conscience
- **King's Champion** — Fights duels on the King's behalf
- **Court Alchemist** — Experimenter, advisor on "science"


## The Politics of Wildcard Roles

Because these roles are **undefined and limited**, they become politically charged:


> **Note**
> **Tensions Wildcard Roles Create**
>
> - **Access envy** — "Why does the Jester have castle access but not me?"
> - **Informal power** — "The Chancellor isn't Marshal, but the King listens to him more"
> - **Favoritism accusations** — "He gave his friend a made-up title just to reward loyalty"
> - **Legitimacy questions** — "What even is a Court Astrologer? This is absurd."
> - **Succession intrigue** — When the King dies, do these roles persist or vanish?


## Historical Parallels


> **Note**
> **Rasputin (Russian Empire, Early 1900s)**
>
> Grigori Rasputin held **no official position** in the Russian government. Yet he became one of the most powerful figures in the realm because Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarina Alexandra believed he had mystical healing powers for their son. His informal influence over appointments, policy, and military decisions made him more powerful than many ministers.
> **This is what Wildcard Roles enable** — power through access and trust, not title.


> **Note**
> **Court Jesters (Medieval Europe)**
>
> Jesters had unique permission to mock kings, nobles, and policy without being punished. This made them **politically valuable** — they could voice dissent disguised as comedy, test public opinion, and deliver bad news without triggering royal anger. Some became trusted advisors because honesty was rare at court.


> **Note**
> **Éminence Grise (Cardinal Mazarin, France)**
>
> The term "power behind the throne" originated with figures who held no official office but controlled monarchs through personal relationship. Cardinal Mazarin was the godfather of Louis XIV and essentially ruled France **through influence alone** during Louis's childhood. Wildcard roles can create these hidden kingmakers.


## Mechanical Benefits


| Benefit | Effect |
|---|---|
| Castle Apartment | Private space inside the royal castle with access to royal halls |
| Court Presence | Legitimized attendance at trials, ceremonies, and court events |
| Proximity to Power | Ability to speak directly to the King in private |
| Social Status | Recognition as someone the King values (for whatever reason) |


## When Wildcard Roles Fail

Wildcard roles are **entirely dependent on the King's favor**. They have no institutional backing:


- **If the King dies** — The role may vanish unless the new King re-appoints them
- **If the King loses trust** — The role can be stripped instantly with no process
- **If the King falls** — The role holder may be targeted as a loyalist
- **If palace politics shift** — Informal influence evaporates without formal power

This makes Wildcard roles **high-risk, high-reward** — tremendous access and influence, but no permanence or protection.
