# 🏪 Player Controlled Vendors

**Guild & Faction-Controlled Commerce**

---


## The Core Rule


> **Note**
> Vendors must be placed inside or directly outside faction/guild controlled buildings.

If you want to be a dedicated crafter, merchant, or trader who directly participates in the game's crafting and trade economy, **you must align yourself with a faction or guild**. You cannot run your craft independently.


## Why This System Exists


> *Traditionally, this is exactly how crafters and merchants worked in medieval times.*

Throughout the medieval period and for a large portion of human history, **guilds controlled crafting in a massive way**. Guilds didn't just regulate quality or prices — they controlled **who could legally make things**.

Blacksmiths, weavers, bakers, cobblers, and every other craft existed within guild structures. Independent craftsmen were often barred from selling in cities, prosecuted for practicing trades without guild membership, or forced to work under guild masters until they earned full membership themselves.

This system recreates that dynamic: **craft power flows through organizations, not individuals.**


## How Player Vendors Work


### Placement Requirements


- You must be a member of a **guild** or **faction**
- The guild must control property (a building with a placed guildstone)
- Vendors can only be placed **inside** or **directly outside** guild controlled buildings


### Vendor Control

As a guild member, you can:


- Place your own vendor at approved guild locations
- Stock the vendor with your crafted goods or traded items
- Set prices for items on your vendor
- Collect revenue from sales (minus guild taxes)


## Guild & Faction Revenue from Vendors


> **Note**
> guilds collect sales taxes on vendor transactions, generating revenue directly from commerce.
> For details on how guild vendor taxes work, tax rates, and economic policy, see: [[Guild & Faction Economy|Guild-Faction-Economy]]


## Why Guilds & Factions Want Crafters

guilds have **powerful incentives** to attract crafters and merchants into their fold:


### 1. Economic Power

Crafters provide:


- Weapons and armor for guild members
- Self-sufficiency (no need to buy from rivals)
- Economic leverage (control supply of critical goods)


### 2. Political Influence

A guild with a monopoly on certain crafts can:


- Set market prices
- Embargo rivals
- Leverage essential goods for political concessions


### 3. Population Growth

Crafters attract customers. Customers create:


- Foot traffic to guild territory
- Opportunities for recruitment
- Visible signs of organizational health and prosperity


## Incentives to Encourage Trade & Commerce


> guilds that encourage trade prosper. Those that don't, wither.

Since vendor taxes directly fund guild and faction operations, leaders have strong incentives to:


- **Protect trade routes:** Safe passage = more customers = more sales
- **Host markets and festivals:** Events drive traffic and vendor sales
- **Recruit skilled crafters:** Better goods = higher prices = more revenue
- **Offer competitive terms:** Attract crafters away from rival organizations
- **Build reputation:** Known marketplaces become destinations

This creates an economic ecosystem where guilds compete not just militarily, but **economically and politically** through commerce.


## No Independent Crafters


> **❗ Note**


### Why This Rule Matters

Preventing independent vendors creates:


- **Organizational dependency:** Crafters need guilds; guilds need crafters
- **Economic competition:** Guilds compete for crafter talent through favorable policies
- **Political entanglement:** Your craft ties you to your organization's conflicts
- **Collective identity:** Crafts become associated with guilds ("Crimson Vanguard steel is the best")


### Gameplay Consequences

This system forces meaningful choices:


- Do you join the powerful guild with high taxes or the struggling guild with low taxes?
- Do you pledge to a faction aligned with Britain or an outlaw faction?
- Do you stay loyal when your guild goes to war, risking your vendor's safety?
- Do you defect to a rival guild when offered better terms?


## Historical Parallels


> **Note**
> **Medieval Guild Control**
>
> In medieval cities, guilds didn't just regulate—they **monopolized**:
> - **London guilds:** Controlled who could sell goods in the city; independent merchants were fined or banished
> - **Florentine guilds:** The Arte della Lana (wool guild) became so powerful it influenced elections and foreign policy
> - **German guilds:** Required years of apprenticeship followed by journeyman work before full membership
> - **Hanseatic League:** A guild confederation that operated its own navy and negotiated treaties like a nation

Guilds weren't just economic organizations—they were **political and military entities** that controlled entire cities and regions.


## Example Scenarios


### Scenario 1: The Blacksmith's Dilemma

You're a master blacksmith who wants to sell legendary weapons. You have two options:


- **Join the Iron Brotherhood (guild):** Britain-aligned, safe and well-protected, strict regulations
- **Join the Shadowfen Marauders (faction):** Outlaw faction, dangerous but offers freedom and higher vendor traffic

Your choice determines not just your revenue, but your political allegiances, customer base, and survival risks.


### Scenario 2: The Guild War

Your guild goes to war with a rival. Enemy forces raid your guild hall and destroy vendors. Now you must:


- Stay loyal and rebuild (lose income, show solidarity)
- Defect to a safer guild (save your business, be branded a traitor)
- Negotiate with the enemy (preserve your vendor, betray your guild)


### Scenario 3: The Economic Policy Dispute

Your guild leader changes economic policies in ways that hurt crafters. Crafters threaten to defect to a rival guild. The leader must choose:


- Revise policies (keep crafters happy, lose some organizational revenue)
- Maintain policies (fund guild priorities, risk losing crafters)
- Negotiate (offer compromises to members who contribute to the guild)


## Summary


- Only guild members can place and control player vendors
- Vendors must be placed inside or directly outside guild controlled buildings
- guilds generate revenue from vendor commerce (see [[Guild & Faction Economy|Guild-Faction-Economy]])
- guilds have strong incentives to attract crafters and encourage commerce
- There are no independent crafters—you must align with an organization to participate in vendor-based trade
- This system creates economic competition, political entanglement, and meaningful organizational loyalty


> *Your craft is not just your livelihood—it is your political identity, your economic allegiance, and your survival tied to the fate of your guild.*
