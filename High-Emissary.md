# 📯 Emissary of the Crown

**Britain's Voice to Factions — Not Powerful, Dangerous to Touch**

---


## Role Overview


| Field | Details |
|---|---|
| Position | Emissary of the Crown |
| Number of Positions | 1 |
| Appointed By | The King |
| Subordinates | Envoys (3, appointed by Emissary of the Crown) |
| Reports To | The King |
| Function | Britain → Factions communication and witnessing |


## Hierarchy & Structure


## What They Actually Do


### They Deliver:


- Recognition (official acknowledgment of faction legitimacy)
- Demands (tribute requirements, compliance orders)
- Warnings (escalation notices, consequences)
- Ultimatums (final notices before action)


### They Witness:


- Fealty oaths (sworn allegiance to Britain)
- Withdrawals (revocation of recognition)
- Public refusals (faction rejections of Britain's authority)


## Why This Role Matters

Emissaries don't negotiate. They don't broker deals. They don't make promises.

**They transmit state intent, not policy creation.**


## Critical Canon Rule


> **❗ Note**
> 
> **Harming an emissary is never "just PvP."
>                 It is a political act Britain must respond to.**
> 

This means:


- Attacking an emissary creates casus belli
- Killing an emissary justifies immediate retaliation
- Interfering with emissary business is a crime against Britain
- PKs have a choice: violence → consequences


## What They Are NOT


- ❌ Negotiators (they don't make deals)
- ❌ Diplomats (they don't create policy)
- ❌ Ambassadors (they don't represent faction interests)
- ❌ Messengers (they carry state authority, not personal messages)
- ❌ Invulnerable (they can be harmed, with consequences)


## Powers & Limitations


### Powers


- Deliver official Britain proclamations
- Witness and record faction responses
- Appoint and dismiss Envoys (Emissary of the Crown only)
- Report directly to the King
- Legal protection under Britain's law


### Limitations


- Cannot make promises or deals
- Cannot alter Britain's position
- Cannot recognize or outlaw factions (only deliver such proclamations)
- Cannot enforce (that's the Guards' role)
- Cannot retreat from witnessing (refusal to witness is dereliction)


## Optional Visual Markers

For enforcement clarity, emissaries may carry:


- Tabard (official Britain colors)
- Royal Seal (proof of authority)
- Color sash (visible identification)
- Scroll case (for official documents)

*Not mandatory, but it helps prevent "I didn't know."*

## How This Creates Gameplay


## Example Scenarios


### Scenario 1: Recognition Delivery

The Emissary of the Crown travels to a faction base to deliver Britain's recognition of their authority. The faction leader publicly accepts, and the emissary witnesses the oath of fealty. This is recorded in the Interfaction Chronicle and the Register of Standing is updated.


### Scenario 2: Ultimatum Delivery

An Envoy delivers an ultimatum to a faction that has failed to pay tribute. The faction leader refuses publicly. The Envoy witnesses and records the refusal. Britain now has justification for sanctions, outlawry, or military action.


### Scenario 3: Emissary Attacked

A faction member attacks an Envoy en route to deliver a warning. The Envoy survives and reports. Britain declares this an act of aggression and withdraws recognition. The faction is now outlawed, and bounties are placed on leadership.


## Summary

The Emissary of the Crown and their Envoys are Britain's official voice to factions. They carry Britain's position, not decisions. They deliver recognition, demands, warnings, and ultimatums. They witness fealty oaths, withdrawals, and public refusals.

Harming an emissary is never "just PvP" — it is a political act that Britain must respond to. Emissaries are not powerful people, but they are dangerous to touch.

This role creates event triggers, escalation points, and accountability without requiring new mechanics. It's a pressure system built on witness and consequence.
