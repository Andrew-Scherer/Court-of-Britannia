# 📜 The Noble Appointments Ledger

**A Record of Authority Exercised and Offices Conferred**

> **❗ Note**
> **On the Nature of Institutional Memory**
>
> The Royal Archives of Britain have stood for generations. Kings have risen and fallen. Regents have governed and been cast down. Civil wars have been fought, and the victors have claimed the throne.
> Through all of this, the Ledger has endured—not because it is sacred, but because it is *useful*. Even tyrants prefer their actions recorded, for a record lends the appearance of order.
> The Ledger does not judge. It simply *remembers*. And memory, in a realm where power changes hands by force as often as by law, is the most dangerous record of all.
