# ⚖️ Britain as the Sole Civic System

**The Sole Civic Authority in a Guild-Driven Realm**

---

> *Britain is the only place where law exists.*  
> *Guilds are the only things that hold land.*  
> *Gold determines survival. Recognition determines legitimacy.*

---

## Core Thesis

**Britain is the only civic institution in the world.**

Everything else—cities, ruins, forts, coves, strongholds—is territorial, not civic. Those places are controlled by **guilds** (and their emergent faction alliances), not governments.

> **📜 Important Terminology**
>
> Throughout this page, when we refer to **"factions"**, we mean **guilds and their alliances** that control territory.
>
> **Remember:** Guilds are the only organization type with mechanics. "Factions" are just emergent alliances of guilds—social constructs with minimal binding mechanics.
>
> **→ See [[Guilds]] and [[Emergent Factions]] for details**

There is no network of city-states.  
There is no shared civic layer.

There is **Britain**…and the world beyond it.

## Britain's Role

Britain is the only place where formal law exists.

**It is the sole source of:**

- Citizenship / Residency
- Courts and legal trials
- Exile and pardon
- Civic taxation
- Salaried public offices
- Official warrants and decrees

**Britain never deactivates.  
Britain cannot collapse mechanically.**

> Britain is not powerful because it controls land.  
> Britain is powerful because it controls **legitimacy**.

---

## The World Beyond Britain

Outside Britain, there are **no cities** in the civic sense.

**There are:**

- Guild-controlled territories
- Pre-placed structures and landmarks (claimed by guilds)
- Economically maintained strongholds (through guild upkeep)
- Contested regions without formal law

> **Territorial Control Logic**
>
> **A place exists politically only if a guild can afford to hold it.**
>
> **If guild upkeep is paid:**
> - The guild controls the space
> - Vendors operate
> - NPCs align
> - Authority exists
>
> **If guild upkeep fails:**
> - Control collapses
> - Buildings open
> - Vendors vanish
> - Power dissolves
>
> **There is no population requirement.  
> There is no civic activation.  
> Only economic viability.**

---

## Guilds as Territorial Powers

Guilds (and their emergent faction alliances) are the primary world actors.

**They:**

- Control land
- Maintain structures
- Enforce their own internal rules
- Rise and fall based on gold flow

**Guild authority is real, but not legal by default.**

A guild can dominate territory without ever being legitimate.

That distinction matters.

## Recognition: Britain's Primary Lever

Britain does not rule guilds.  
Britain **recognizes** them—or refuses to.

**Recognition is Britain's only outward-facing power.**

### Recognition States

A guild exists in one of three states relative to Britain:

#### 1. Recognized

Britain treats the faction as a legitimate authority

- Trade is lawful
- Warrants are honored
- Fealty and taxation may apply
- Violence against them is politically constrained

#### 2. Tolerated

Britain neither recognizes nor suppresses

- No tribute
- No protection
- Gray-zone legitimacy
- Smugglers, mercenaries, radicals thrive here

#### 3. Outlawed

Britain declares the faction illegitimate

- Warrants invalid
- Trade restricted or sanctioned
- Violence against them is justified politically
- **The faction still exists—just outside the law**

> Recognition can be granted, withdrawn, or challenged.  
> It is never permanent.

---

## Fealty: Britain & Guilds

Fealty exists only between Britain and guilds.

**A guild may swear fealty to Britain.**

**Fealty means:**

- Automatic tribute from guild treasury
- Public alignment with Britain
- Expectation (not guarantee) of protection
- Legitimacy in the eyes of the realm

**Fealty is:**

- Voluntary to enter
- Costly to leave
- Public
- Breakable

> **[!WARNING]**
> **Britain does not appoint guild leaders.  
> Britain does not control guild land.**
>
> Britain extracts gold and grants legitimacy.

---

## Residency — Britain Only

Residency survives, but only here.

**Residency as legal standing in Britain:**

- Residency = citizenship in Britain
- Exile = loss of standing in Britain
- Residency ends on permadeath

There is no residency system for guilds or territories beyond Britain.

---

## Gold Is Power

There is only one universal activation check:

> **Can you pay?**

- **Guild upkeep** determines territorial survival
- **Tribute** drains guild resources
- **Overreach** kills empires
- **Collapse** is automatic and visible

There are no admin switches.  
No population math.  
No artificial timers.

> **Gold flow replaces bureaucracy.**

---

## Law vs Territory

This distinction is absolute:

| Concept | Britain | The World |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Law** | ✅ Exists | ❌ None |
| **Courts** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Citizenship** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Exile** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Territory Control** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Upkeep-Based Power** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

> Britain governs **people**.  
> Guilds govern **places**.

---

## Violence & Legitimacy

Britain does not prevent violence.  
**It defines whether violence is justified.**

- **Killing a recognized guild leader** is an act of war
- **Killing an outlawed leader** is enforcement
- **Attacking tolerated guilds** is politically ambiguous

The system does not judge morality.  
Players do.

---

## Outlawry Instead of Rebellion

Britain does not "fight rebels."

**Britain withdraws recognition.**

**Outlawed guilds:**

- Still exist
- Still control territory
- Are illegitimate
- Violence against them becomes justified politically

> **However:**
>
> It is quite possible that a rebellious guild, if they grow strong enough, can **take control of Britain through brute strength**.
>
> If the King dies and a rebel guild takes control of the coronation ceremony, if timing and execution work in their favor, a surviving member of their guild can **crown themselves King and completely take over the administrative function of Britain**.

### Historical Context: William the Conqueror (1066)

1. William invades England (technically illegal)
2. He wins one decisive battle
3. He gets crowned King

**After the coronation:**

- All remaining English resistance is declared outlawry
- Those still fighting are not "defenders" — they are criminals

---

## The Political Ledger

All recognition, fealty, tribute, and outlawry is recorded publicly.

**The ledger:**

- Enforces nothing
- Hides nothing
- Forgets nothing

> **History is the punishment.**

---

## Design Canon

**These rules are absolute:**

1. **Britain is the only civic authority**
2. **Guilds are the only territorial powers**
3. **Gold determines survival**
4. **Recognition determines legitimacy**
5. **Nothing is enforced—everything is visible**

There is no empire mechanic.  
There is no reset button.

**Only choices, pressure, and consequences.**
