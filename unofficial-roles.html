        <h1>⚔️ Unofficial Roles</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Self-Titled Professions in a World with Consequences</p>

        <!-- Introduction -->
        <section>
            <h2>What Are Unofficial Roles?</h2>
            <p>In most Ultima Online servers, certain professions simply cannot exist meaningfully. Without permadeath, without political systems that matter, without economic pressure that creates real demand—these roles become hollow roleplay at best.</p>
            
            <p>On Kingdoms of Britannia, permadeath changes everything. Political intrigue has teeth. Economic failure has consequences. Violence has permanence. And because of this, an entire ecosystem of <strong>unofficial roles</strong> emerges—professions that players claim for themselves without anyone's permission.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Core Principle:</strong></p>
                <p>"You don't need a decree to become an assassin. You just need clients, targets, and the skill to survive."</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>These roles are <strong>self-titled</strong>. No official appointment. No ceremony. No ledger entry. You claim the profession, you build your reputation, and the world reacts accordingly. Some of these professions have mechanical support. Most do not—and that's by design. Your reputation is your credential.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Hired Blade -->
        <section>
            <h2>Hired Blade</h2>
            <p><em>Game of Thrones Equivalent: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater</em></p>
            
            <p>The Hired Blade is a fighter-for-hire, a sellsword who takes contracts for gold. Unlike organized mercenaries, a Hired Blade operates independently or in small crews. They are:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Duelists for hire:</strong> Settle disputes through trial by combat</li>
                <li><strong>Enforcers:</strong> Intimidate rivals, collect debts, deliver messages with muscle</li>
                <li><strong>Bodyguards:</strong> Protect a client during dangerous travel or political meetings</li>
                <li><strong>Problem solvers:</strong> Handle "delicate situations" that clients can't address openly</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Why This Role Exists:</strong> Permadeath makes violence meaningful. A King who fears assassination needs protection. A merchant who owes gold needs enforcement. A noble who faces a trial by combat needs a champion. The Hired Blade fills those gaps—for the right price.</p>
            
            <p><strong>No Mechanics Required:</strong> This is pure player-to-player interaction. Contracts are verbal or written agreements. Payment is negotiated. Success or failure is determined by skill.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Assassin -->
        <section>
            <h2>Assassin</h2>
            <p>The Assassin is the dark mirror of the Hired Blade—a killer who operates from the shadows, taking contracts to eliminate specific targets permanently.</p>
            
            <p>Assassins exist because permadeath creates demand:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A rival claimant wants the King dead before coronation</li>
                <li>A guild leader wants a troublesome member removed quietly</li>
                <li>A faction wants a Crown official eliminated to destabilize Britain</li>
                <li>A merchant wants a competitor removed from the market</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>The Black Market Bounty System:</strong> Unlike the official <a href="bounty.html">Crown Bounty System</a>, assassins operate under the table. Contracts are made privately. Payment is off the books. Success is measured by whether the target dies—and whether the assassin survives to collect.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Risk and Reward:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If caught, assassins face <a href="execution-mechanics.html">execution</a></li>
                <li>If successful, they gain gold, reputation, and future clients</li>
                <li>If they fail, they may be hunted by guards, the target's allies, or rival assassins</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Political Fallout:</strong></p>
                <p>Assassinations don't just kill individuals—they destabilize governments. A successful hit on a King triggers <a href="succession.html">succession crises</a>. A dead noble creates power vacuums. The ripple effects make assassination a political tool, not just murder.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Mercenaries -->
        <section>
            <h2>Mercenaries (Organized)</h2>
            <p>When faction-vs-Crown-vs-guild diplomacy breaks down, organized mercenaries step in to rebalance the scales. Unlike Hired Blades who work solo, mercenary companies operate as guilds or factions—offering military services to the highest bidder.</p>
            
            <h3>What Mercenary Companies Provide</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Military force:</strong> Provide troops for sieges, raids, or defensive contracts</li>
                <li><strong>Training:</strong> Teach combat skills to guild members or faction soldiers</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic counsel:</strong> Advise clients on military tactics and political maneuvering</li>
                <li><strong>Neutrality (for a price):</strong> Remain uncommitted until paid, allowing smaller factions to punch above their weight</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Why Mercenaries Matter</h3>
            <p>In a world where <a href="military.html">Britain's Military</a> can refuse orders, where <a href="guards.html">Guards</a> may side with factions over the Crown, and where guilds rise and fall based on political maneuvering—mercenaries provide a predictable, purchasable solution. They fight for gold, not ideology.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example Scenario:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A small faction is under threat from a larger rival</li>
                <li>They hire a mercenary company for 50,000 gold</li>
                <li>The mercenaries provide 20 skilled fighters for 2 weeks</li>
                <li>The faction survives, the mercenaries get paid, and the balance of power shifts</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Mercenaries are especially valuable to factions that are <strong>Outlawed</strong> or <strong>Tolerated</strong> under the <a href="britain-factions.html">Crown's recognition system</a>—they can't rely on Britain's protection, so they buy it.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Escort / Bodyguard -->
        <section>
            <h2>Escort / Bodyguard</h2>
            <p>Like mercenaries but at a smaller, more personal scale. Escorts and bodyguards sell protection—not for armies, but for individuals traveling dangerous roads, attending hostile meetings, or moving valuable cargo.</p>
            
            <h3>Services Offered</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Travel protection:</strong> Guard merchants transporting goods between cities or faction territories</li>
                <li><strong>Event security:</strong> Protect nobles during public ceremonies, trials, or political gatherings</li>
                <li><strong>VIP escort:</strong> Accompany high-value targets (Kings, heirs, diplomats) through hostile areas</li>
                <li><strong>Courier security:</strong> Ensure sensitive messages or items reach their destination</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Why This Role Exists:</strong> Permadeath makes travel risky. A merchant carrying 100,000 gold in trade goods doesn't want to travel alone. A diplomat negotiating with an Outlawed faction needs muscle. A claimant gathering support in faction territories needs protection from assassins.</p>
            
            <p>Bodyguards trade on reputation. A single failed contract—where the client dies—can destroy credibility. Success builds trust and commands higher prices.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Bounty Hunter -->
        <section>
            <h2>Bounty Hunter</h2>
            <p>Bounty hunters pursue Crown-issued bounties through the official <a href="bounty.html">Bounty System</a>. Unlike assassins who work in the shadows, bounty hunters operate within the law—capturing or killing targets with legal authorization.</p>
            
            <h3>How Bounty Hunters Operate</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Track targets:</strong> Use rumors, informants, and observation to locate wanted individuals</li>
                <li><strong>Choose capture or kill:</strong> Some bounties reward capture; others pay for confirmed death</li>
                <li><strong>Deliver proof:</strong> Bring the target to guards or present evidence of elimination</li>
                <li><strong>Collect payment:</strong> Receive gold mechanically through the bounty system</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Why Bounty Hunters Matter</h3>
            <p>Not all criminals stay in Britain's jurisdiction. Outlawed factions harbor fugitives. Exiled nobles flee to rival territories. The Crown can issue bounties, but <a href="guards.html">Guards</a> may lack the reach—or the will—to pursue them. Bounty hunters fill that gap.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Legal Gray Area:</strong></p>
                <p>Bounty hunters often operate outside social norms. They may:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enter faction territory without permission</li>
                    <li>Use deception, bribery, or intimidation to locate targets</li>
                    <li>Kill targets in public, claiming legal immunity under the bounty</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This makes them effective—but not necessarily popular.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>Anyone can become a bounty hunter.</strong> There's no appointment, no official role. You see a bounty. You pursue it. You collect or you die trying.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Merchant and Shopkeep -->
        <section>
            <h2>Merchant and Shopkeep</h2>
            <p>In-game shop ownership is real. <a href="guilds.html">Guilds</a> and <a href="factions.html">factions</a> control properties and place <a href="player-controlled-vendors.html">player-run vendors</a>. A marketplace can form when multiple buildings cluster together—creating organic economic hubs.</p>
            
            <h3>Examples of Player-Driven Commerce</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blacksmith Guilds:</strong> Operate weapon and armor shops within city walls</li>
                <li><strong>Faction Marketplaces:</strong> Control multiple buildings and create a defacto player marketplace</li>
                <li><strong>Traveling Merchants:</strong> Move goods between cities, buying low and selling high</li>
                <li><strong>Specialty Craftsmen:</strong> Focus on rare or high-demand goods (legendary weapons, rare reagents, custom armor)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Why Merchants Matter</h3>
            <p>Merchants aren't just vendors—they're economic engines. They:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generate <a href="guild-faction-economy.html">tax revenue</a> for guilds and factions</li>
                <li>Attract foot traffic to faction territories</li>
                <li>Create dependencies (if one guild monopolizes a critical resource, they gain political leverage)</li>
                <li>Fund wars, upkeep, and expansion through commerce</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>A successful merchant can become wealthier and more influential than many nobles—without ever holding an official title.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Farmer -->
        <section>
            <h2>Farmer</h2>
            <p>Many <a href="housing.html">homes and plots of land</a> come with fertile ground. Farmers cultivate crops, raise livestock, and supply food to cities, guilds, and factions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Why Farming Exists as a Profession:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Food may be required for upkeep or faction sustenance (server-dependent)</li>
                <li>Crops can be sold to provisioners or used in alchemy and cooking</li>
                <li>Control over food supply creates economic leverage</li>
                <li>Farmland ownership ties players to territories and faction politics</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Farmers are often overlooked—until a siege cuts off food supplies and cities begin to starve. Then, farmers become strategic assets.</p>

        <!-- Public Prosecutor (Non-Crown) -->
        <section>
            <h2>Public Prosecutor (Non-Crown)</h2>
            <p>With a functioning <a href="jail.html">justice system</a>, players may need advocates to argue their defense—or to prosecute accused criminals. The Crown has its own legal apparatus, but unofficial prosecutors operate outside royal authority.</p>
            
            <h3>What Public Prosecutors Do</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Argue cases:</strong> Present evidence, question witnesses, and advocate for clients during trials</li>
                <li><strong>Negotiate plea deals:</strong> Work with guards, magistrates, or the Crown to reduce sentences</li>
                <li><strong>Contest unjust arrests:</strong> Challenge the legal basis of <a href="arrest-ledger.html">arrests</a> or <a href="execution-mechanics.html">executions</a></li>
                <li><strong>Represent factions:</strong> Defend faction members accused of crimes against the Crown</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Why This Role Matters:</strong> Not everyone charged with a crime is guilty. Not every execution is just. Prosecutors provide a social (and sometimes political) counterweight to Crown authority. A skilled prosecutor can save lives, expose corruption, or delay politically motivated trials long enough for allies to intervene.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Courtier -->
        <section>
            <h2>Courtier</h2>
            <p><em>Status • Multiple • Self-Claim or Social Recognition</em></p>
            
            <p>The Courtier is power without a title—influence without appointment. They inhabit the space between commoner and noble, between outsider and insider, shaping decisions through proximity, gossip, and social maneuvering rather than formal authority.</p>
            
            <h3>What Courtiers Represent</h3>
            <p>Courtiers can represent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A Guild:</strong> Advocating for guild interests at court, negotiating favorable terms, warning of Crown policies that harm their organization</li>
                <li><strong>A Faction:</strong> Acting as an unofficial voice for an outlawed or tolerated faction, building relationships that protect their people</li>
                <li><strong>Themselves:</strong> Operating independently, accumulating favors and leverage without formal allegiance</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Some courtiers serve one master loyally. Others play all sides. The best courtiers make everyone believe they're on their side.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Courtiers Exist</h3>
            <p>Courtiers exist because <strong>proximity to the Crown equals power</strong>. The closer you are to the King, the Regent, the Marshal, or the High Emissary, the more you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shape policies before they're declared:</strong> A whispered suggestion in the King's ear becomes tomorrow's decree</li>
                <li><strong>Intercept information before it spreads:</strong> Knowing what's coming gives factions time to prepare, hide, or strike first</li>
                <li><strong>Protect allies and harm rivals:</strong> A courtier can warn friends of coming arrests or ensure enemies are "mentioned" during council meetings</li>
                <li><strong>Accumulate social capital:</strong> Every favor owed, every secret known, every connection made increases their value and safety</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Courtiers don't pull the lever—they decide who does.</p>
            
            <h3>How Courtiers Operate</h3>
            <p>Unlike official roles, courtiers have no mechanical powers. Their influence is entirely social and reputational. They operate through:</p>
            
            <h4>Social Jousting</h4>
            <p>Court is a battlefield where words replace swords. Courtiers compete to remain <strong>socially and influentially relevant</strong> because the moment they're ignored, they lose everything. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public wit and charm:</strong> Being memorable, quotable, entertaining—making sure people seek your company</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic flattery:</strong> Praising the right people at the right time without appearing sycophantic</li>
                <li><strong>Controlled leaks:</strong> Revealing information selectively to prove you're "in the know"</li>
                <li><strong>Social triangulation:</strong> Connecting rivals to manufacture conflicts that benefit you</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Gossip as Currency</h4>
            <p>Courtiers trade in information. They:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Overhear conversations between nobles</li>
                <li>Observe who meets privately and what happens afterward</li>
                <li>Track patterns: who's gaining favor, who's falling out, who's desperate</li>
                <li>Spread rumors—sometimes true, sometimes strategic lies—that shape perception</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>A skilled courtier knows more than the <a href="roles.html">Master of Whispers</a>—they just don't have official sanction.</p>
            
            <h4>Connecting Factions</h4>
            <p>Courtiers serve as informal intermediaries between:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Crown and outlawed factions (back-channel negotiations that can't be official)</li>
                <li>Rival guilds who need to cooperate but can't be seen meeting directly</li>
                <li>Foreign powers and Britain (facilitating trade or diplomacy without official <a href="diplomacy.html">Envoys</a>)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>When official channels fail or can't be used, courtiers fill the gap—for a price.</p>
            
            <h3>Courtiers vs Official Roles</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Why Not Just Appoint Them?</h3>
                <p>Official advisors like the <strong>Chancellor</strong> or <strong>Chamberlain</strong> (see <a href="roles.html">Official Roles</a>) serve at the King's pleasure and carry formal authority. Courtiers exist <em>outside</em> that system, which makes them:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Deniable:</strong> The Crown can disavow their actions if needed</li>
                    <li><strong>Flexible:</strong> They can advocate for ideas the King can't publicly support</li>
                    <li><strong>Dangerous:</strong> Their loyalty is social, not structural—it can shift</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A courtier representing a guild serves that guild first, the Crown second. An official advisor serves the Crown—supposedly.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Motivations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gain favor:</strong> Accumulate social capital with the Crown, nobles, and factions</li>
                <li><strong>Stay relevant:</strong> Remain visible, valuable, and "in the room" when decisions are made</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid blame:</strong> Never be the one holding the knife when things go wrong</li>
                <li><strong>Climb quietly:</strong> Position yourself for appointment to official roles—or make yourself so valuable you don't need them</li>
                <li><strong>Shape the world:</strong> Use proximity to the Crown to bend policy toward your worldview, guild interests, or faction survival</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Responsibilities (Self-Imposed)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advise:</strong> Offer counsel to nobles, even if they don't ask for it</li>
                <li><strong>Gossip:</strong> Spread information (true or false) that benefits your position</li>
                <li><strong>Connect factions:</strong> Broker introductions, negotiations, and alliances</li>
                <li><strong>Attend everything:</strong> Trials, coronations, executions, public decrees—visibility equals relevance</li>
                <li><strong>Read the room:</strong> Sense shifts in power and adjust allegiances before it's too late</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Natural Conflicts</h3>
            <p><strong>Everyone. Especially each other.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Courtiers compete for the same social space, the same access, the same ears. This creates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rival courtiers:</strong> Undercutting each other's credibility, spreading counter-gossip, stealing credit</li>
                <li><strong>Official advisors:</strong> Resenting courtiers who bypass formal channels</li>
                <li><strong>Guards and Military:</strong> Viewing courtiers as manipulative parasites who whisper while soldiers fight</li>
                <li><strong>Factions:</strong> Suspicious that courtiers claiming to represent them are actually double agents</li>
                <li><strong>The Crown:</strong> Useful until they become too influential—then they're threats</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Player Fantasy</h3>
            <p><strong>"You never pull the lever—you decide who does."</strong></p>
            
            <p>Courtiers get:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access to spaces where decisions are made</li>
                <li>The thrill of social combat—wit, timing, and charisma as weapons</li>
                <li>The ability to protect allies and destroy enemies without violence</li>
                <li>The satisfaction of watching your whispered suggestion become tomorrow's decree</li>
                <li>The risk of being caught in the fallout when your schemes collapse</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>How to Play a Courtier</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Be present:</strong> Attend every public event. Trials, coronations, decrees, executions—if nobles are there, you're there.</li>
                <li><strong>Listen more than you speak:</strong> Gather information before you spend it.</li>
                <li><strong>Make yourself useful:</strong> Connect people who need each other. Offer information that solves someone's problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Choose your allegiance carefully:</strong> Representing a guild or faction gives you backing—but also limits your flexibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Never be the most powerful person in the room:</strong> Courtiers survive by being <em>adjacent</em> to power, not holding it directly.</li>
                <li><strong>Know when to shift allegiances:</strong> Courtiers who stay loyal to falling regimes fall with them.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong></p>
                <p>Courtiers live and die by reputation. One exposed lie, one failed scheme, one betrayal too many—and you're exiled from court. No one will meet with you. No one will trust you. And no title or decree can restore that.</p>

        <!-- Guild and Faction Specific Roles -->
        <section>
            <h2>Guild and Faction Specific Professions</h2>
            <p>Beyond the professions listed above, guilds and factions will develop their own internal roles to manage their organizations. These roles are entirely player-defined and will vary based on each organization's structure and priorities.</p>
            
            <h3>Examples of Internal Roles</h3>
            
            <h4>Leadership Organization</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Council Members:</strong> Advisors to the guildmaster or faction leader</li>
                <li><strong>Succession Planners:</strong> Manage internal succession when leaders die</li>
                <li><strong>Internal Magistrates:</strong> Resolve disputes between guild members</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Diplomatic Organization</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ambassadors:</strong> Negotiate with other factions, guilds, or the Crown</li>
                <li><strong>Spies and Informants:</strong> Gather intelligence on rivals</li>
                <li><strong>Treaty Negotiators:</strong> Draft <a href="faction-interactions.html">formal agreements</a> with other organizations</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Military Organization</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Generals and Commanders:</strong> Direct faction military forces during conflicts</li>
                <li><strong>Trainers:</strong> Teach combat skills to new recruits</li>
                <li><strong>Scouts:</strong> Survey enemy positions, trade routes, and vulnerabilities</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Economic Organization</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Treasurers:</strong> Manage faction/guild <a href="faction-guild-banking.html">banking</a> and <a href="faction-guild-upkeep.html">upkeep</a></li>
                <li><strong>Tax Collectors:</strong> Oversee vendor revenue and internal taxation</li>
                <li><strong>Trade Negotiators:</strong> Establish trade agreements with other guilds or factions</li>
                <li><strong>Quartermaster:</strong> Manage resource stockpiles, equipment distribution, and supply lines</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These roles emerge organically based on need. A small guild may have none of them. A powerful faction may have dozens. The server doesn't enforce these structures—players create them.</p>

            <h2>What Will You Become?</h2>
            <p>This list is not exhaustive. It's a starting point. The professions described here exist because the server's systems—permadeath, political conflict, economic pressure, and player agency—create the conditions for them to matter.</p>
            
            <p>But you're not limited to these roles. As you explore Kingdoms of Britannia, ask yourself:</p>

                <h3>Questions to Inspire Your Path</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What niche can you fill?</strong> Is there a service no one else provides? A gap in the market? A need that others overlook?</li>
                    <li><strong>How do the server's rules create opportunities?</strong> Does permadeath enable a profession that couldn't exist elsewhere? Does the political system create demand for a specific skill?</li>
                    <li><strong>What reputation do you want to build?</strong> Are you a trusted mediator? A feared enforcer? A cunning spy? A reliable supplier?</li>
                    <li><strong>Can you create a profession that doesn't exist yet?</strong> What if you became the server's first insurance broker, offering to compensate clients if their goods are stolen? What if you became a professional mediator, resolving disputes between factions for a fee? What if you became a historian, documenting major events and selling your chronicles?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>The server gives you tools. You give them meaning.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Can <em>you</em> think of unique professions that would fit within this world, thanks to changes to the game's fundamental rules, laws, and dynamics? What role will you claim? What reputation will you build? What will you become when the world has real consequences?</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Final Thought:</strong></p>
                <p>"In a world where death is permanent, where politics matter, and where every player is writing history—there are no NPCs. Every profession is real. Every choice has weight. And every player is someone's story."</p>
