# Design New Game System

Use this workflow when creating a completely new game system for Kingdoms of Britannia.

## Step 1: Philosophical Foundation

Answer these questions first:

### Core Philosophy Alignment
- **Which of the three pillars does this system reinforce?**
  - [ ] Death Is Permanent
  - [ ] Power Is Political
  - [ ] Legitimacy Is Everything

- **What political pressure does this create?**
  - Write 2-3 sentences describing the tension this system introduces

- **What happens when key players die?**
  - Describe succession, continuity, or collapse mechanics

### Design Principle Check
- **Does this create pressure or chores?**
  - Force a decision: ___
  - Delay a decision: ___
  - Reframe a decision: ___
  - Make a decision dangerous: ___
  - ⚠️ If none of the above, reconsider this system

- **Can this run without babysitting?**
  - What happens if everyone logs off? ___

- **What are the consequences of inaction?**
  - List 3 specific consequences: ___

## Step 2: Player Archetype Service

For each archetype, determine engagement level:

| Archetype | Engaged? | How? |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Socializers | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |
| Killers | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |
| Achievers | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |
| Explorers | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |
| Schemers | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |
| Institutional Loyalists | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |
| Crafters | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |
| Tragic Players | ☐ Yes ☐ No | |

**Minimum:** System should meaningfully engage at least 3 archetypes

**Warning:** If this only serves 1-2 archetypes, it might be too narrow

## Step 3: Core Mechanics Design

### What Players Actually Do
Describe the core loop in 3-5 bullet points:
- 

### Resource/Time Investment
What do players spend?
- Time: ___
- Gold: ___
- Political capital: ___
- Risk: ___

### Decision Points
List the key decisions players make:
1. 
2. 
3. 

### Timers & Automation
What prevents stalls?
- Timer 1: ___ (duration: ___)
- Timer 2: ___ (duration: ___)
- NPC fallback: ___

## Step 4: Integration with Existing Systems

### Roles Involved
Which roles interact with this system?

**Direct Control:**
- 

**Affected By:**
- 

**Can Disrupt:**
- 

### System Touchpoints
| Existing System | Interaction Type | Specific Touch Point |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Justice | ☐ Direct ☐ Indirect ☐ None | |
| Property | ☐ Direct ☐ Indirect ☐ None | |
| Economy | ☐ Direct ☐ Indirect ☐ None | |
| Guilds/Factions | ☐ Direct ☐ Indirect ☐ None | |
| Political Systems | ☐ Direct ☐ Indirect ☐ None | |

### Ledgers & Records
What new public records are needed?

**New Ledger:** 
- Name: ___
- Tracks: ___
- Updated by: ___
- Viewed by: ___

**Existing Ledgers Updated:**
- 
- 

## Step 5: Edge Case Analysis

### Death Scenarios
- **What happens when the system's primary role holder dies?**
  - 

- **What if multiple key players die simultaneously?**
  - 

- **What if an organization running this system collapses?**
  - 

### Exploitation Vectors
- **Could parasitic griefers abuse this system?**
  - ☐ Yes ☐ No
  - If yes, how? ___
  - Mitigation: ___

- **Does this create mandatory gatekeeping?**
  - ☐ Yes ☐ No
  - If yes, how? ___
  - Alternative: ___

- **Could this bottleneck the world?**
  - ☐ Yes ☐ No
  - If yes, how? ___
  - Bypass: ___

### Extreme Usage
- **What if no one uses this system?**
  - Does the world break? ___
  - Does it matter? ___

- **What if everyone uses it constantly?**
  - Server load: ___
  - Economic impact: ___
  - Political impact: ___

## Step 6: Refinement Questions

Before finalizing, ask:

1. **Could this be simpler while achieving the same pressure?**
   - 

2. **Does this accidentally punish bold play?**
   - 

3. **Is there a way to make inaction more consequential?**
   - 

4. **Could this system generate emergent unofficial roles?**
   - 

5. **Does this create story hooks for Tragic Players?**
   - 

## Step 7: Documentation Plan

### Primary Page
- **File location:** `/[Category]/[System-Name].md`
- **Category:** ___

### Cross-References Needed
Pages that should link to this system:
- 
- 

Pages this system should link to:
- 
- 

### Ledger Documentation
If creating new ledgers, document:
- Location: `/Ledgers/[Name].md`
- Format: ___
- Update triggers: ___

## Step 8: Prototype Write-Up

Write a draft of the system documentation following EDITING_RULES.md:
- Single source of truth
- Constitutional tone
- No redundancy
- Mechanical focus over narrative
- Clear cross-referencing

**Draft:**
```markdown
# [System Name]

## Overview
[2-3 sentences: What is this? Why does it exist?]

## How It Works
[Core mechanics, player actions, timers]

## Roles Involved
[Who can interact with this system?]

## Edge Cases
[Death, inaction, abuse prevention]

## Records
[Ledgers created/updated]

## See Also
- [[Related System 1]]
- [[Related System 2]]
```
