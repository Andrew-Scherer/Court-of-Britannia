# ⚔️ The Royal Army

**Authority Through Force and Projection**

---


> **Note**
> **📋 Individual Royal Army Role Pages**
>
> This page provides an overview of Britain's Royal Army organization. For detailed information about each specific role:
> - [[⚔️ Lord of the Royal Army|High-Commander]] — Noble authority and strategic command
> - [[🛡️ Captain of the Crown|Field-Commander]] — Professional leadership and organization
> - [[🗡️ Knight of Britannia|Soldier]] — Sworn elite warrior and embodiment of Virtue


## What the Royal Army Is


> *Britain's Royal Army is not law enforcement and not governance. It is the Crown's capacity to project violence beyond the city walls and to survive environments where law does not function.*

Where Guards make authority visible, the Royal Army makes authority possible.

They exist to:


- Fight where arrest is meaningless
- Hold territory through presence
- Deter threats before they reach Britain
- Remind everyone that the city is not defenseless

Like the Guards, the Royal Army serves authority as it exists in practice, not theory.


## Guards vs Royal Army: Critical Distinction


> **Note**
> **City Guards**
>
> - Law enforcement inside Britain
> - Answer to courts and magistrates
> - Duties: arrest, patrol, jail
> - Not expeditionary


> **Note**
> **Royal Army**
>
> - External force projection
> - Used against outlaw factions, in protectorates, as occupation presence
> - Not bound by civilian law the same way
> - Lethal force is default, not exception


> **❗ Note**


## Why Play This?

If Guards are about:


- Order
- Restraint
- Legality
- Public legitimacy

The Royal Army is about:


- Survival
- Force
- Initiative
- Political leverage

Royal Army players get:


- External campaigns
- Patrol authority outside the city
- Command of armed groups
- Strategic power
- And the long-term temptation to stop obeying civilians

**This is the role for players who want power that isn't clean.**


## Philosophy


> Guards ask: "Is this lawful?"The Royal Army asks: "Will this hold?"

The Royal Army assumes:


- Violence is expected
- Enemies won't submit to arrest
- Legitimacy comes after control
- Hesitation kills

This difference is why Guards and the Royal Army cooperate—and why they mistrust each other.


## Authority and Allegiance

Royal Army authority flows through appointment, just like the Guards—but from a parallel chain, not the same one.

**Sources of authority:**


- **The Crown** — Ultimate legitimacy
- **The Lord of the Royal Army** — Operational control
- **Captains of the Crown** — Local authority
- **Officers** — Unit-level leadership


> **❗ Note**
> - Magistrates
> - Courts
> - Wardens
> - City law
> That exemption is intentional and dangerous.


## Hierarchy and Appointments


| Rank | Max | Appointed By | Can Appoint |
|---|---|---|---|
| ⚔️ Lord of the Royal Army | 1 | King | Captains of the Crown |
| 🛡️ Captain of the Crown | 1 per 10 Knights (scales with army size) | Lord of the Royal Army | Officers |
| 🗡️ Knight of Britannia | Unlimited | Officer | None |


### Lord of the Royal Army

The Lord of the Royal Army controls Britain's external violence.

They:


- Decide where forces are deployed
- Define rules of engagement
- Command campaigns and protectorates
- Control fortifications outside the city
- Determine when military force replaces diplomacy


> **❗ Note**
> A loyal Lord of the Royal Army protects the realm. An ambitious one doesn't need permission.
> Historically, Kings fall not when armies lose—but when they stop obeying.


### Captains of the Crown

Captains of the Crown control:


- Regions
- Borders
- Protectorates
- Major external threats

They act with the authority of the Lord of the Royal Army when distant from Britain and must make decisions without civilian oversight.

Captains of the Crown build:


- Personal loyalty networks
- Hardened veterans
- Regional power bases

**They are the most common source of military coups.**


### Knights of Britannia

Knights of Britannia are:


- Professional fighters
- Trained for lethal combat
- Accustomed to loss and brutality
- Loyal to officers before ideals

They are not peacekeepers. They are not guards. They are force applied until resistance ends.


## Core Duties

The Royal Army is responsible for:


- External patrols beyond city walls
- Escorting caravans and nobles through hostile lands
- Holding protectorates and occupied territories
- Responding to large-scale threats (raids, invasions, monsters)
- Conducting punitive expeditions
- Establishing forward camps and forts
- Supporting Guards during internal emergencies (by request or decree)


## Use of Force


### Lethal Force (Standard)

Unlike Guards, lethal force is the default.

The Royal Army:


- Kills enemies
- Breaks resistance
- Does not attempt arrest unless ordered
- Does not preserve enemies for trial

**Mercy is strategic, not procedural.**


## Relationship With the Guards


> Fireman vs Police


### Normal State: Cooperation


- Guards maintain internal order
- Royal Army handles external threats
- Guards request Royal Army aid during crises
- Royal Army defers to Guards inside Britain


### Tension State: Jurisdictional Conflict


- Royal Army claims threat justifies action inside city
- Guards insist on law and restraint
- Arrest vs execution disputes
- Chain-of-command ambiguity


### Crisis State: Alignment or Schism

If:


- **Marshal and Lord of the Royal Army cooperate** → Britain becomes authoritarian
- **Marshal and Lord of the Royal Army oppose** → Britain fractures
- **Royal Army bypasses Guards** → Soft coup
- **Guards block Royal Army** → Civil conflict risk

*This is intentional.*


## Political Ambition & Risk (Critical)

Like the Guards, the Royal Army is structurally capable of takeover.


### Danger Signs


- Knights loyal to commanders, not Crown
- Royal Army acting without Guard coordination
- Forts controlling supply routes
- Captains of the Crown ignoring recalls
- Guards "requesting" Royal Army presence inside city


> **❗ Note**
> - Suspend courts
> - Control access
> - Neutralize rivals
> - Rule "temporarily" for stability
> History says temporary never ends.


## Summary


- Britain's Royal Army is a parallel power structure to the Guards, focused on external force and survival
- Authority flows through a separate chain, creating cooperation and rivalry
- Lethal force is standard; law is secondary
- High-ranking military nobles can become powerful political actors
- Alignment between Royal Army and Guards creates authoritarian potential
- Conflict between them signals regime instability
- The Royal Army exists to make protection, occupation, and escalation visible
- Captains of the Crown are the most common source of military coups
- A Lord of the Royal Army aligned with a Marshal represents existential threat to civilian rule


## Final Truth


> *You didn't want "soldiers." You wanted a second sword, a second loyalty network, a second path to tyranny. You now have it.*
