# ⚔️ Guilds & Factions at War

**When Loyalty Divides the Court**

---


> *When rival factions hold positions in the same government,the question is not whether conflict will occur —but whether the King can survive it.*


## The Core Tension

Britain allows players to hold both **court positions AND guild/faction leadership** simultaneously. This creates a fundamental tension: when your guild goes to war with another faction, but that faction's leader sits on the King's council, what happens?

This isn't a bug. It's the entire point.

Throughout history, governments have been staffed by people with conflicting loyalties, rival houses, and competing factions. The question was never "How do we prevent conflict?" It was "How do we manage it without collapse?"


## Historical Parallel: The Wars of the Roses (1455-1487)


> **Note**
> **York vs Lancaster in the Same Government**
>
> The Wars of the Roses weren't just battles between armies — they were conflicts between **rival noble houses holding positions in the same royal government**.
> **The Setup:**
> - The **House of York** and **House of Lancaster** were both branches of the Plantagenet dynasty
> - Both houses had members serving as royal advisors, military commanders, and regional governors
> - King Henry VI (Lancaster) appointed Yorkist nobles to his council to maintain peace
> - The result: **a government staffed by people actively plotting against each other**
> **What Happened:**
> - Richard, Duke of York served as **Lord Protector** (essentially Regent) while plotting to take the throne
> - Yorkist nobles held military commands and used them to position forces for rebellion
> - Lancaster loyalists in government leaked plans, sabotaged appointments, and undermined York at every turn
> - When war broke out, each side's government positions became strategic assets
> **The Lesson:** Rival factions holding government positions creates a **cold war within the state** that can erupt into open conflict at any moment.


## Scenario 1: Warring Factions in the Same Court


## Scenario 2: Your Faction at War with Your Superior's Faction


## Scenario 3: Justice Is Never Blind


> **❗ Note**

**Answer: He probably doesn't.**


## Scenario 4: The New King's Purge


> **❗ Note**

**Answer: He probably kicks them all out.**


## The Design Philosophy

These scenarios are not problems to solve. They are **the gameplay**.


> **Note**
> **Why This System Works**
>
> - **Player agency** — You choose between loyalty to court vs loyalty to faction
> - **Meaningful consequences** — Every choice creates enemies and allies
> - **Emergent drama** — No scripted events needed; conflict arises naturally from structure
> - **Historical accuracy** — This is how governments actually functioned
> - **Permadeath stakes** — Betrayal can mean permanent character loss, raising the tension

The question is never "How do we prevent conflicts of interest?" The question is: "**When will you betray your faction? When will you betray the Crown? And what will you do when forced to choose?**"


## Practical Outcomes

**For Players:**


- Holding both a court position and faction leadership makes you powerful but vulnerable
- Every appointment is a political calculation: "Can I trust this person?"
- Justice becomes negotiable based on who has power
- Regime changes are existential threats to officeholders

**For Kings:**


- You must balance rival factions in government or risk civil war
- Purging too many officials leaves you without competent administrators
- Keeping rivals in power invites coups and sabotage
- Your success depends on managing these tensions, not eliminating them

**For Factions:**


- Placing members in court positions is strategic infiltration
- Court positions can be weaponized against rival factions
- Losing a member's court position is a major setback
- Faction wars escalate when fought through government institutions
