# 🏠 Sharing Housing

**Encouraged, Not Punished**

---


## The Core Conclusion


> Players should be able to live togetherwithout fragmenting into shell guilds.


## Why This Matters

In traditional UO housing systems:


- Storage is tied to buildings
- Trust means vulnerability
- Cohabitation risks theft
- Players form single-person guilds to avoid risk
- Guilds fragment instead of cohere

This creates a paradox:


> Players who want to cooperateare mechanically punished for doing so.


## How This System Fixes It

Because:


- Storage is personal (bank-based)
- Housing is social, not mechanical
- Betrayal belongs in politics, not closets

The result:


- Multiple people can live in the same building safely
- Each resident accesses their own bank box
- No theft risk from housemates
- No permission micromanagement
- No forced trust or vulnerability


## What This Prevents


> **Note**
> **Shell Guild Fragmentation**
>
> Without shared housing support, players are incentivized to:
> - Create 1-person guilds
> - Bid against their own allies
> - Drive up property prices artificially
> - Weaken the guild system overall
> Shared housing removes this incentive entirely.

This:


- Reduces incentive to create 1-man guilds
- Prevents artificial price inflation on historic property
- Supports the 1-historic-property-per-guild rule
- Keeps guilds as meaningful, cohesive institutions


## How It Works In Practice


### Example: A Guild Fortress

A guild claims an Orc Fort at auction.


- 10 guild members live there
- Each member has bank access from the fort
- Each member stores personal items in their own bank
- The fort is decorated collaboratively
- Vendors are placed by guild officers
- Social space is shared
- Storage is individual

**No theft.**  

**No conflict.**  

**No micromanagement.**


### Example: Mixed Housing

A city inn has multiple residents from different guilds.


- A merchant guild member
- An independent craftsman
- A diplomat from another guild

Each:


- Uses the inn as a home base
- Accesses their own bank
- Never conflicts over storage
- Coexists without forced alliance


## Why This Supports the One-Property Rule

The 1-historic-property-per-guild rule only works if players can **comfortably live together**.


> **Note**
> **Without Shared Housing Support**
>
> - 10 friends = 10 shell guilds
> - 10 shell guilds = 10 potential historic properties
> - Map becomes fragmented
> - Guilds lose meaning


> **Note**
> **With Shared Housing Support**
>
> - 10 friends = 1 guild
> - 1 guild = 1 historic property
> - Map stays contested
> - Guilds remain meaningful

Shared housing is not a convenience feature.  

**It's a load-bearing pillar of the guild system.**


## Betrayal Still Exists

Removing storage conflict doesn't remove **political conflict**.

Betrayal still happens:


- Defection to rival guilds
- Revealing strategic information
- Political sabotage
- Breaking alliances
- Switching allegiance under pressure


> The betrayal that mattershappens in the world,not in closets.


## What About Guild Banks?

Guild banking is a separate system entirely.

It handles:


- Pooled guild funds
- Shared resources for upkeep
- Collective economic management

But it does NOT function as:


- Personal storage for individuals
- A replacement for housing storage
- A loot vault

See [[Guild Banking|Guild-Banking]] for details.


## The Design Is Intentional

Some players will feel this is "too safe" or "removes risk."

That misunderstands the goal.


> **Note**
> **Risk Belongs in Conflict, Not Cohabitation**
>
> The goal is not to maximize paranoia.
> The goal is to make **cooperation easy** and **conflict meaningful**.

Shared housing ensures:


- Guilds form naturally
- Alliances hold together without forced trust
- Conflict happens over territory and politics
- Not over who stole whose sword from a chest
