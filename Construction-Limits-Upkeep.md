# Construction Limits & Upkeep Scaling

## Purpose

Construction limits exist to prevent structural spam while preserving player freedom, creativity, and emergent settlement design.

Instead of hard caps, construction is regulated through **economic pressure**.  
Building is always allowed — but increased complexity increases upkeep.

---

## Core Principle

> **Land supports construction for free up to a point.  
> Beyond that, complexity increases upkeep.**

There are no artificial limits on what players may build.  
The world naturally limits excess through cost.

---

## Construction Density

Each property includes a **base construction allowance** tied to the number of world tiles it controls.

### Base Allowance

* Each world tile supports **up to three (3) constructed objects**
* Construction within this allowance does **not** increase upkeep
* This allowance is shared across the entire property

Examples:

* 10-tile property → 30 constructed objects
* 100-tile property → 300 constructed objects
* 500-tile property → 1,500 constructed objects

This allows functional buildings, walls, and interior spaces without penalty.

---

## Upkeep Scaling Beyond the Base Allowance

Once construction exceeds the base allowance, **property upkeep increases progressively**.

### Scaling Behavior

* Base construction allowance incurs **no additional upkeep**
* For every additional block of **100 constructed objects beyond the allowance**, upkeep increases
* The increase applies to the **entire property**, not individual structures

Upkeep scales smoothly and continuously.  
There is no sudden cutoff or maximum.

## Concrete Example

### Property

* Size: 100 tiles
* Base construction allowance: 300 constructed objects

---

### Construction Levels

**Up to 300 constructed objects**

* No additional upkeep
* Property remains at base upkeep

**400 constructed objects**

* 100 over allowance
* Upkeep increases modestly

**600 constructed objects**

* 300 over allowance
* Upkeep increases further

**1,000 constructed objects**

* 700 over allowance
* Upkeep reflects the high construction density

At every stage:

* Construction remains allowed
* The only constraint is economic sustainability

---

## What Counts Toward Construction Density

The following **count toward construction density**:

* floors
* walls
* roofs
* doors
* stairs
* structural dividers

These are considered **functional structures** that shape space.

---

## What Does NOT Count Toward Construction Density

The following **do not count** toward construction density and **do not affect upkeep**:

* cosmetic decorations
* lights
* banners
* rugs
* purely visual props

Decoration is always free.  
Expression is never taxed.

---

## Why This System Works

* Prevents wall, maze, and spam abuse naturally
* Avoids arbitrary or immersion-breaking hard limits
* Scales cleanly with property size
* Encourages intentional, meaningful construction
* Keeps decoration accessible to all players
* Aligns settlement growth with economic responsibility

Large, complex settlements are possible — but must be supported.

---

## Summary

> **Build freely.  
> Pay for complexity.  
> Decoration is always free.**

Construction density is regulated by upkeep, not permission.  
The world remains expressive, readable, and alive.
