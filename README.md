## Documentation Structure

### GitHub Wiki Format

All documentation is now in **Markdown format** (.md files) optimized for GitHub Wiki:

- **Home.md** - Main landing page (replaces index.html)
- **_Sidebar.md** - Contains structured navigation with all categories
- **74+ Content Pages** - All game mechanics, roles, and systems documented

### Navigation

The wiki uses GitHub Wiki navigation:
- **_Sidebar.md** contains the complete navigation structure with dropdown categories
- Internal links use wiki-style syntax: `[[Display Text|Page-Name]]`
- All pages are in the root directory for easy access

### Documentation Guidelines

All pages follow strict guidelines defined in `EDITING_RULES.md`:
- Single source of truth principle
- Constitutional tone
- No redundancy
- Mechanical focus over narrative
- Clear cross-referencing between related systems

## Design Philosophy

- **Authority Through Process**: No single role controls everything
- **Automatic Resolution**: Systems function without requiring human intervention
- **Public Accountability**: All use of force and power is recorded
- **Political Consequence**: Actions create leverage, not just outcomes
- **Timer-Based Systems**: Prevent gameplay stalls and bottlenecks
- **Player Agency**: Unofficial roles and emergent gameplay opportunities
