**Two-Account System: Treasury and Upkeep Ledger**

---


## Philosophy: Why Two Accounts?

guilds maintain two separate financial constructs to prevent ambiguity, exploitation, and political circumvention:


- **Prevents Ambiguity:** There is no debate about whether deposited gold is "for upkeep" or "for hoarding." Intent is explicit at the moment of deposit.
- **Prevents Hoarding Through Upkeep:** The Upkeep Ledger cannot be used as a vault. Gold converted to upkeep credit is destroyed as wealth—it becomes time, not treasure.
- **Supports Political Pressure via Liens:** Crown liens may intercept Treasury income to starve a faction's growth without killing its survival. This creates economic siege conditions without backdoor eviction.

This separation ensures that economic enforcement remains political pressure, not mechanical deletion.


## The Two-Account System


| Feature | Treasury (Bank) | Upkeep Ledger |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | General guild wealth | Prepaid upkeep credit only |
| Withdrawable? | ✅ Yes (with permissions) | ❌ No, never |
| Used For | Commerce, salaries, war funds, purchases, stockpiling | Automatic daily upkeep payments only |
| Deposit Process | Player chooses "Deposit to Treasury" | Player drags gold to "Add to Upkeep" (converts to credit) |
| Crown Lien Impact | ✅ Subject to interception | ❌ Cannot be touched by lien |
| Storage Limit | No limit | Capped at 14 days of upkeep credit |
| Repurposable? | Yes | No—credit is burned |


## Treasury (Bank)


### Definition

The Treasury is the guild's general bank account. It functions as withdrawable, repurposable wealth.


### Used For


- Paying member salaries or rewards
- Purchasing goods, weapons, or supplies
- Funding war efforts or bounties
- Commerce and trade
- Hoarding wealth for future use


### Access & Permissions

Treasury access is controlled by the guild leader via the faction stone or guild gump:


- **Leader:** Full access (deposit, withdraw, view, set permissions)
- **Treasurer (designated officer):** May deposit, withdraw, and view transactions
- **Standard Members:** No access by default (leader may grant deposit-only or view-only permissions)


### Deposits

Players interact with the faction stone or guild gump and select **"Deposit to Treasury."** Gold is transferred from inventory into the Treasury account.


### Withdrawals

Only authorized members (leader or designated treasurer) may withdraw gold from the Treasury. Withdrawals are logged in the transaction history.


## Upkeep Ledger


### Definition

The Upkeep Ledger is **not a bank**—it is a prepaid meter. Gold deposited into the ledger is converted into **upkeep credit**, which is used exclusively to pay the guild's daily upkeep cost.


### Key Characteristics


- **Non-Withdrawable:** Once gold is added, it cannot be reclaimed, transferred, or repurposed.
- **Non-Transferable:** Credit cannot be moved to another faction, guild, or player.
- **Automatic Deduction:** Each day, the upkeep cost is automatically deducted from the ledger balance.
- **Capped Storage:** The ledger may hold a maximum of **14 days** of upkeep credit.


### Why 14 Days?

A two-week cap ensures the ledger is used for **survival buffer**, not wealth storage. It prevents factions from bypassing Crown liens by stockpiling months of gold as "upkeep." This cap:


- Allows reasonable planning for vacations or downtime
- Prevents indefinite economic immunity
- Forces factions under lien to continue generating income or negotiate


### How to Add to the Ledger

Players interact with the faction stone or guild gump and select **"Add to Upkeep."** They drag gold from inventory, and it is immediately:


- Removed from the world economy
- Converted into upkeep credit (measured in days/hours)
- Recorded in transaction history


### Access & Permissions


- **Leader:** May add gold to upkeep and view ledger balance
- **Designated Treasurer:** May add gold to upkeep and view ledger balance
- **Standard Members:** May view ledger balance (cannot add unless granted permission)

Leaders may optionally grant "add to upkeep" permission to trusted members, allowing collective responsibility for survival.


## Intentional Deposits

Deposits to Treasury versus Upkeep Ledger are **always intentional**. There is no automatic sorting, no hidden logic, no ambiguity.


## Records & Transparency

Both the Treasury and Upkeep Ledger maintain full transaction histories, viewable by authorized members:


### Treasury Transaction Log


- Date and time of deposit
- Depositor name
- Amount deposited
- Withdrawals (who, when, how much)
- **Lien Intercepts:** Amount intercepted by Crown lien, date, and decree reference


### Upkeep Ledger Log


- Date and time of upkeep payment
- Who added credit
- Amount added (in gold and resulting days of credit)
- Daily upkeep deductions (automatic)
- Remaining balance (in days/hours of coverage)

These logs provide accountability, prevent embezzlement, and offer political ammunition in disputes.


## Crown Liens Interaction

A **Crown Lien** is a legal restriction placed on a faction stone by royal decree. It intercepts surplus revenue but **cannot interfere with upkeep payments**.


### What a Lien Can Do


- ✅ Intercept gold deposited into the **Treasury**
- ✅ Intercept vendor proceeds before they reach the Treasury
- ✅ Intercept donations or income flowing into the Treasury
- ✅ Freeze discretionary spending (if configured by decree)


### What a Lien Cannot Do


- ❌ Touch the **Upkeep Ledger**
- ❌ Prevent upkeep payments
- ❌ Block players from adding gold directly to the Upkeep Ledger
- ❌ Force upkeep failure


### Why This Distinction Matters

If a lien could block upkeep, it would be **backdoor eviction by decree**—a mechanical deletion disguised as political pressure. Instead, liens create a **siege economy**:


- The faction can **survive** (upkeep still payable)
- The faction cannot **grow** (all surplus income seized)
- The faction must **choose**: pay the Crown, negotiate, or fight


> **❗ Note**
> **Doctrine:** Crown liens restrict surplus revenue but do not prevent payment of mandatory upkeep. Failure of upkeep under lien is treated as sovereign collapse, not eviction.


## Common Scenarios


## Failure & Abuse Prevention


### Anti-Exploit Rules


## Summary

guilds maintain two financial constructs: the **Treasury** (withdrawable general wealth) and the **Upkeep Ledger** (non-withdrawable prepaid meter). Deposits are always intentional—players explicitly choose which account receives gold.

The Treasury is subject to Crown liens, which may intercept income as political pressure. The Upkeep Ledger is protected from liens, ensuring that economic enforcement does not become backdoor eviction. The ledger has a 14-day cap to prevent hoarding disguised as upkeep planning.

This two-account system ensures clarity, prevents exploitation, and supports political consequences without destroying player agency or faction survival.
