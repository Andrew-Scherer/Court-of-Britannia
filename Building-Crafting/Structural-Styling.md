# Structural Styling

## Purpose

Structural Styling allows settlements to define the **architectural identity** of their constructed buildings.

It enables builders to transform neutral construction pieces into themed structures—stone keeps, orc palisades, pirate shanties—**without changing the underlying construction**.

Structural Styling changes *how buildings look*, not what they are.

---

## Core Philosophy

> **Builders shape space.  
> Styling defines identity.  
> Ownership never changes.**

Structural Styling is architectural, not decorative.

It is intentional, visible, and tied to settlement identity.

---

## What Structural Styling Is

Structural Styling is the process of applying a **themed visual variant** to an existing structural element.

It affects:

* Walls
* Floors
* Roofs
* Doors

Styling does **not** affect:

* collision
* access permissions
* construction density
* upkeep cost
* ownership
* durability

A styled wall is still the same wall.

---

## Relationship to Construction

Structural Styling applies only to **confirmed construction**.

* Builders place structural elements using building parts
* Once confirmed, those elements may be styled
* Styling never consumes building parts
* Styling is always reversible

Construction creates structure.  
Styling gives it character.

---

## Builder Authority

Structural Styling is controlled by **Builders**.

By default:

* Any player with Builder permission may apply or remove structural styling
* Styling authority is always explicitly granted
* Decorators do not control structural styling unless granted this authority

Styling is architectural power and is treated as such.

---

## Themed Structural Variants

Each architectural theme provides a set of **structural variants**.

Themes define how core construction elements appear.

For example:

* Wall → Stone Wall / Orc Wall / Pirate Wall
* Floor → Stone Floor / Mud Floor / Deck Planks
* Door → Reinforced Gate / Bone Door / Ship Hatch

Themes may include multiple variants for the same element.

Example:

* Orc Wall (Timber & Bone)
* Orc Wall (Spiked Palisade)

Builders choose the variant explicitly.

## Applying Structural Styling

### Selection Rules

* A builder enters Structural Styling mode
* The first selected element defines the selection type
* Only elements of the same type may be selected in a batch
  * Wall → walls only
  * Floor → floors only

This prevents accidental cross-styling.

---

### Styling Process

1. Select one or more structural elements
2. Choose a theme from the settlement's active themes
3. Choose a variant provided by that theme
4. Apply styling

The selected elements immediately update.

No preview mode is required:

* Styling is reversible
* Reapplying replaces the previous style

---

## Reversibility

Structural Styling is fully reversible.

Builders may:

* change a styled element to another variant
* remove styling entirely, reverting it to neutral construction

Styling does not lock decisions.

---

## Theme Availability & Enforcement

Structural Styling is strictly limited to **active settlement themes**.

Rules:

* Builders may only apply styles from themes currently available to the settlement
* If a theme is removed:
  * all styling from that theme is immediately stripped
  * affected structures revert to neutral appearance

This prevents:

* theme laundering
* temporary contributor abuse
* permanent architectural borrowing

Identity follows authority.

---

## No Styling Budget

Structural Styling does **not** count against decoration limits.

Reason:

* the structure already exists
* the cost was paid at construction time
* styling does not add complexity or objects

Styling is a visual state, not an additional object.

---

## Governance Controls

Settlement leadership may:

* Remove all structural styling
* Remove all styling from a specific theme
* Remove styling applied by a specific player:
  * last 24 hours
  * last 7 days
  * all time

These controls exist to resolve:

* griefing
* aesthetic mistakes
* theme transitions
* sabotage

---

## Design Intent

This system ensures that:

* architecture reflects political control
* settlements have strong visual identity
* builders, not decorators, shape cities
* themes remain meaningful and enforceable
* construction stays simple and modular
* visual complexity does not equal mechanical power

---

## Summary

> **Construction defines form.  
> Styling defines character.  
> Authority defines identity.**

Structural Styling gives settlements a soul—  
without compromising ownership, balance, or clarity.
