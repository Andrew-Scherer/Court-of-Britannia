# Carpentry: Logistics Items

## Purpose

Carpentry supports the **Logistics System** by producing standardized shipping containers required for global trade. Unlike building parts (which are consumed by structures), logistics items are consumed by **commerce**.

## The Export Crate

**The fundamental unit of international trade.**

To ship goods out of the [Britain Trade Docks](../Economy/Banking-System.md#britain-trade-docks-logistics-hub), merchants must package them into a certified **Export Crate**.

### Mechanics

*   **Crafted By:** Carpenters
*   **Ingredients:** Boards (Wood), Iron Ingots (Nails/Reinforcement)
*   **Function:**
    *   Acts as a valid container for hauling contracts.
    *   **Required** for any export contract originating from Britain.
    *   **Consumed** (or permanently attached) when the contract is sealed at the docks.
    *   Cannot be used as a backpack replacement (too heavy/bulky for foot travel when loaded).

### Economic Role

1.  **Material Sink:** Turns wood and iron into a consumable trade commodity.
2.  **Gatekeeper:** Prevents "loose item" spam at trade hubs.
3.  **Role Dependency:** Merchants *must* buy from Carpenters to trade efficiently.

## Future Logistics Items (Planned)

*   **Reinforced Crate:** Higher durability/security for dangerous routes.
*   **Smuggler's Crate:** False bottom (lower visual value vs actual contents).
*   **Bulk Pallet:** For massive distinct resource shipments.
