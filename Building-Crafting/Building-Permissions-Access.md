# Building Permissions & Access Control

## Core Philosophy: Public & Political

> **Housing is about where you stand in the world, not what you hide behind walls.**

The housing system in Kingdoms of Britannia is designed to be **institutional, not personal**. Properties are assets of influence, utilized by guilds and factions to project power.

### The "No Storage" Rule
**Housing is not for storage.**
*   There are no secure chests.
*   There are no locked down containers that only *you* can open.
*   Valuables belong in the **Bank**.
*   Housing is for: Crafting, vendors, meetings, sleeping, and roleplay.

Because there is no loot to steal, **access can be shared freely**. You do not need to fear a roommate "stealing your stuff" because your stuff shouldn't be there.

## Institutional Authority (The Seat)

Property is not owned by a character; it is owned by a **Role** (the "Seat").

> **The Seat binds the land.**
> **The Guild operates the land.**

When a player holds the **Steward** (or equivalent) title, they are filling the **RoleSeat**.
*   If the player deletes their character, the **Seat** remains.
*   The next player to take the Seat immediately inherits control of the property.
*   Ownership is continuous and resilient to individual player churn.

---

## The Interface: The Plaque

All permissions and access controls are managed physically at the **House Plaque**.

The Plaque is the control center for the property's **Region**.
*   **Double-Click**: Open the Property Management Menu.
*   **Manage Access**: Set Public/Private/Guild status.
*   **Manage Roles**: Assign Governors, Builders, and Decorators.
*   **Pay Tax**: Manually deposit upkeep funds.

Permissions set at the Plaque apply to the **entire region** defined by the property's plot.

---

## Operational Roles

Day-to-day management is delegated to Guild Roles. These are assigned via the Plaque.

### 1. Property Governor
The administrator of the specific property.
*   **Can**: Assign other roles, change public/private access, pay taxes.
*   **Cannot**: Sell the property, unbind it from the guild (only the Seat Holder can do this).

### 2. Builder
Authorized to **shape space**.
*   **Can**: Place construction parts (walls, floors) within the region.
*   **Cannot**: Change access rules, ban players.
*   **Note**: Builders consume *Guild* resources or their own resources to build.

### 3. Decorator
Authorized to **cosmetic expression**.
*   **Can**: Place and move non-structural items (furniture, lighting).
*   **Cannot**: Build/Remove walls, change access.

### 4. Merchant
Authorized to **commerce infrastructure**.
*   **Can**: Place and assign Vendor stalls.
*   **Cannot**: Access the inventory or gold of vendors they do not personally own.

---

## Access Control: Region-Based

Access is strictly **Region-Based**.
*   There are **no keys**.
*   There are **no door codes**.
*   There are **no individual door locks**.

If you have access to the **Property**, you have access to **every door** on that property.
*   You cannot lock a single room for yourself.
*   You cannot lock a chest for yourself.

### Access Levels
1.  **Public**: Anyone may enter (Taverns, Shops).
2.  **Guild**: Only guild members may enter.
3.  **Role/Rank**: Only specific ranks (e.g., Officers) may enter.
4.  **List**: Specific friends/allies from other guilds.

## The Ultimate Access Control: Eviction

The state maintains the right to seize property.
*   **72-Hour Notice**: If the King or City Council orders an eviction, a 72-hour timer begins on the Plaque.
*   **Resolution**: If the issue is not resolved (diplomatically or financially), the property is seized.
*   **Effect**: The Seat is stripped, and the property reverts to the state or opens for auction.

This mechanic ensures that no one sits on land indefinitely without maintaining their political standing.
