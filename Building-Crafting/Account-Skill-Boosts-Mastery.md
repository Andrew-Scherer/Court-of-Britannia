# Account Level Skill Boosts & Mastery

## Purpose

Skill progression exists to ensure that new and fallen players can return to relevance quickly, while preserving the meaning of mastery, risk, and loss.

Characters are mortal.  
Experience is not wasted.

This system rewards long-term dedication without allowing power to persist through death.

---

## Core Philosophy

> **Skills improve everywhere.  
> Experience compounds across lives.  
> Power must always be earned again.**

The system does not dictate where players must train or how they must play.  
It simply reflects that learning accelerates with danger and that mastery leaves a lasting mark.

# Skill Progression & Mastery Memory

## Skill Gain by Environment

All skills can improve in all environments.  
The difference is **velocity**, not permission.

| Environment    | Description                                                         | Skill Gain Velocity    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **City**       | Organized, controlled areas including duel pits and training spaces | Slower than wilderness |
| **Wilderness** | Open world, uncontrolled territory                                  | Baseline               |
| **Dungeons**   | Enclosed, contested, high-risk environments                         | Fastest overall        |

Players choose where they learn.  
Risk determines how quickly they progress.

---

## Player vs Player Skill Gain

Skill gain from PvP actions occurs at the same rate as PvE actions in the same environment.

Combat against players is real experience.

---

## Death and Mastery Memory

When a character dies:

* All skill values are lost
* No power carries over
* No dominance is preserved

However, mastery changes the player permanently.

If an **account** has previously raised a skill to **90 or higher**, that skill is remembered as mastered.  
Future characters relearn mastered skills faster, particularly at high levels.

This represents **experience and knowledge**, not retained strength.

---

## Re-Learning Boost — Combat Skills

For combat skills previously mastered on the account (90+):

| Skill Range | Re-Learning Speed |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| **0–60**    | ~**1.1×**         |
| **60–90**   | ~**1.5×**         |
| **90–100**  | ~**2.5×**         |

Early skill progression remains accessible to everyone.  
The true reward of mastery appears where the grind once existed — at the top end.

A veteran recovers faster, but must still earn relevance, gear, position, and survival.

---

## Re-Learning Boost — Crafting Skills

Crafting follows the same philosophy, with stronger recovery due to its time investment and economic importance.

For crafting skills previously mastered on the account (90+):

| Skill Range | Re-Learning Speed |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| **0–60**    | ~**1.25×**        |
| **60–90**   | ~**1.75×**        |
| **90–100**  | ~**3.0×**         |

Only learning speed is affected.

No materials, recipes, quality, tools, or outputs carry over.  
A master crafter's knowledge survives death. Their workshop does not.

---

## What This System Creates

* New players reach relevance quickly
* Fallen players recover without despair
* Mastery has lasting value
* Experimentation across roles is encouraged
* Veterans are rewarded without becoming immortal
* Power continues to circulate through death, risk, and conflict

The world remains dynamic.  
History continues to move.

# Account Mastery & Character Creation

## The Mastery Gump

Character creation is not the beginning of a character's power.  
It is the continuation of a player's legacy.

> **Characters are temporary.  
> Mastery endures.**

Every life contributes to an account's accumulated mastery.  
Each death closes a chapter, but permanently records what was learned.

---

## The Mastery Interface

During character creation, players are presented with the **Mastery Gump**.

This interface displays:

* All skills available in Ultima Online
* Which skills the account has previously mastered
* Which skills remain unexplored

The gump is informational, not mechanical.  
It does not grant skills, points, or power.

It shows **history**.

---

## What the Gump Represents

The Mastery Gump is a **ledger of lived experience**.

Each highlighted skill represents:

* A life once lived
* A role once mastered
* Knowledge that can never be taken away

Unhighlighted skills represent:

* Untold stories
* Unlived lives
* Future possibilities

This is not a build planner.  
It is a legacy record.

---

## Skill States

Each skill displayed in the gump exists in one of two states:

### Unmastered

* The account has never raised this skill to mastery
* No long-term learning benefits are associated

### Mastered

* The account has previously raised this skill to mastery (90+)
* Future characters relearn this skill faster at high levels
* No skill values, power, or items carry over

Mastery reflects **knowledge**, not retained strength.

---

## Relationship to Character Creation

When creating a new character:

* Players freely choose starting skills as normal
* The Mastery Gump does not restrict or enforce choices
* It exists to **inform and inspire**, not optimize

A player may:

* Revisit a previously mastered role
* Explore a role they have never played
* Intentionally pursue a new mastery for their account

Every choice is valid.  
Every life contributes.

---

## Death and Mastery Lock-In

When a character dies:

* All character skills are lost
* All character power ends
* Account mastery is updated, if applicable

If a skill reached mastery during that life, it is permanently recorded on the account.

Death becomes a moment of:

* Loss
* Closure
* **Legacy confirmation**

Instead of focusing on what was lost, players are encouraged to reflect on what was secured.

---

## Psychological Impact (Design Intent)

This system exists to change how players experience permadeath.

Instead of:

> "I lost everything."

Players think:

> **"That life mattered."**

The Mastery Gump makes progress visible *before* loss occurs, setting expectations from the very first character.

Permadeath becomes:

* A narrative conclusion
* A progression checkpoint
* A reason to continue, not quit

---

## Encouraging Role Diversity

Because mastery persists at the account level:

* Players are not punished for experimentation
* Switching roles is rewarded, not discouraged
* Meta stagnation is reduced over time

A player may live:

* A mage's life
* A fencer's life
* A crafter's life
* A role they never tried before

Each life expands the account's legacy.

The system encourages players to **experience Ultima fully**, not efficiently.

---

## What This System Does Not Do

The Mastery Gump does not:

* Grant free skills
* Carry over skill values
* Preserve power through death
* Replace the danger of the world
* Undermine permadeath

It records experience.  
Power must always be earned again.

---

## Summary

> **Every life leaves a mark.  
> Every death records a legacy.  
> The world remembers what you have mastered.**

> **Characters die.  
> Mastery persists.  
> Power is always earned again.**

The Mastery Gump exists to make permadeath survivable, meaningful, and aspirational—without ever making it safe.
