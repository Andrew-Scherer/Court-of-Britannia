# 📜 Faction Ledger

**Distributed Identity. No Central Authority.**

---


## Core Principle


> *Factions do not have a central physical anchor.They exist through distributed presence.*

Each member guild may place a **Faction Ledger** within its own property, near its guildstone.

The ledger:


- Publicly signals faction alignment
- Provides shared identity and coordination interfaces
- Exists only as long as the guild controls the property


## What a Faction Ledger Is

A Faction Ledger is:


- A **physical object**
- Placed by a guild inside its own property
- Always **subordinate to the guildstone**
- A window into a shared faction identity


> **Note**
> **What It Is NOT**
>
> - An anchor
> - A source of authority
> - A property claim
> - A sovereign object


> Think of it as:"This guild publicly records that it flies this banner."


## Placing a Faction Ledger

Every guildhouse can place a **Faction Ledger** in the guild house.


> **Note**
> **Ledger Placement**
>
> - Placed by the guild leader or authorized members
> - Located near the guildstone
> - Acts as the faction interface for that guild


## Joining an Existing Faction

From the Faction Ledger, a guild leader can:


1. View the current list of factions
2. Apply to join an existing faction
3. Once accepted, the guild officially joins the faction


> **Note**
> **Unlocked Ledger Tabs**
>
> Once a faction is joined, the Faction Ledger unlocks additional tabs:
> - **Member Guilds** — View all guilds that are members of the faction
> - **Messaging** — Faction-wide messaging and announcements
> - **Intelligence** — Shared reconnaissance and enemy sightings
> - **Faction Charter** — Ideology, goals, and propaganda
> - **History** — Guild joins/leaves logged publicly


## Creating a New Faction

A guild also has the option of **creating their own Faction** using the Faction Ledger.


> **Note**
> **Faction Creation Process**
>
> The guild leader can:
> - Give the faction a name
> - Set faction settings (charter, ideology, etc.)
> - Declare the faction active
> Once created:
> - The faction appears on the global faction list
> - Other guilds can apply to join
> - The founding guild's ledger becomes the first instance of this faction


> **❗ Note**
> Creating a faction does **not** grant the founding guild any mechanical authority over other guilds who join.
> Leadership remains emergent and social, not mechanical.


## Leaving a Faction

To leave a faction:


- Access the Faction Ledger
- Select "Leave Faction"
- Instant, no cooldown, no penalty

Alternatively:


- Remove or destroy the ledger
- This also severs the faction connection

This is exactly in line with the emergent faction philosophy.


## What Happens When a Guild Loses Property

If a guild loses its land:


- The guild loses its land
- Its ledger disappears with the property
- The faction loses that guild's presence
- Other guild ledgers remain untouched


> **❗ Note**
> The ledger is subordinate to the guild's property claim.  
> 
>             Lose the property → ledger is gone.


> New owners never inherit faction ledgers.Zero paradox.


## Why Distributed Ledgers Work


### No More "Rival Faction Stone on Conquered Land"

Because:


- The ledger only exists where the guild exists
- Lose the property → ledger is gone
- New owner never inherits it
- Zero paradox


### Factions No Longer Need a "Host"

There is no single object whose loss causes confusion.

If one guild falls:


- Its ledger disappears
- The faction continues elsewhere
- Nothing needs to "transfer"


> You cannot kill a faction.You dismantle what stands beneath it.


### Factions Stay Non-Sovereign by Construction

There is:


- No central object
- No land binding
- No legal anchor

All accountability still flows to guilds.


## Potential Ledger Functions

Faction Ledgers can provide **informational** coordination:


> **Note**
> **Faction Announcements**
>
> Messages propagate to all ledgers.


> **Note**
> **Shared Intelligence**
>
> Last known enemy sightings, reconnaissance reports.


> **Note**
> **Faction Charters**
>
> Ideology, goals, propaganda.


> **Note**
> **Soft Coordination**
>
> "Call to arms" notices (no mechanics, just information).


> **Note**
> **Faction History**
>
> Guild joins / leaves logged publicly.


> **❗ Note**
> - No buffs
> - No protection
> - No authority
> Exactly the right level.


## Design Elegance

This design aligns three critical elements:


- **Design elegance** — Simple, intuitive, no edge cases
- **Code simplicity** — Reuses guild property logic
- **Lore coherence** — Physical and local, not abstract


> *Factions persist only through the continued participation of guilds.There is no single object to seize, destroy, or inherit.*


## Final Philosophy


> No central stone.No host required.No sovereignty bleed.Just guilds flying banners.
