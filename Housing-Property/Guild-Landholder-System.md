**When Organizations Control Land**

---

## Core Principle

All property in Britannia can be bought and sold freely—**except when a Guild is connected to it**.

When a Guild Leader places their Guildstone on a property they own, that property becomes **Guild-locked**: they cannot transfer or sell it while the Guild remains active.

---

## 1. Establishing a Guild Seat

### Acquiring Property
A Guild Leader can acquire property through:
1. **Private Purchase** (buying from another player, subject to Transfer Tax)
2. **Public Auction** (bidding on unclaimed/abandoned properties, starting at 1gp)

### Placing the Guildstone
Once the Guild Leader owns the property:
1. **Guild Leader places Guildstone** on the property
2. **Property becomes Guild Seat** (Guild-locked)

### The Lock
Once the Guildstone is placed:
- **Guild Leader retains legal ownership** (Title Holder)
- **Guild Leader CANNOT sell or transfer** the property
- **Property functions as the Guild's Seat** (permanent base)
- **Property remains Guild-locked** until the Guild disbands

> *Once you plant your guild's banner, the land beneath it becomes immovable.*

---

## 2. Death & Succession

### When the Guild Leader (Landholder) Dies
If the Guild Leader suffers **Permadeath**:

1. **Guild appoints a new Leader** from among its members
2. **New Leader becomes Landholder** (inherits the Title)
3. **Property remains Guild-locked**
4. **No auction, no public claim window**

### The Assassination Risk
Because the Guild controls succession, the Guild Leader is **extremely vulnerable** to internal conspiracy:

- The Guild may assassinate their Leader and appoint a more loyal replacement
- The Leader's only protection is **trust** and **value to the Guild**
- External assassination offers **no benefit** to attackers (Guild still chooses replacement)

> *A Guild Leader with a Guildstone planted is a hostage to that Guild's loyalty.*

---

## 3. Disconnection & Forfeiture

### When the Guildstone is Removed
If the Guild Leader removes the Guildstone or disbands the Guild:

1. **Property is immediately forfeited** (goes to public auction)
2. **Property is treated as abandoned** (auction starts at 1gp)
3. **Guild Leader CANNOT reclaim or sell** the property
4. **Property returns to circulation** for other players/guilds

### The Cost of Guild Seats
This creates an elegant economic model:
- **Guild creation is free** (no charter fee)
- **The property IS the cost** (must acquire land first)
- **Cannot resell for profit** (forfeited on disbanding)
- **Barrier to entry is property value** (serious commitment required)

### The Mutual Lock (While Active)
- The Guild Leader **can disband the Guild** (but forfeits the property)
- The Guild **cannot seize ownership** from the Leader (they hold the Title)
- If the Leader dies, the Guild selects the successor (who inherits the Title)

> *Plant your banner knowing you cannot profit from the land beneath it.*

---

## 4. One Guild, One Property

To encourage conflict and spread power:
- A Guild may hold **only ONE property**
- A Guild Leader may only plant **ONE Guildstone**

If a Guild attempts to acquire a second property, they must remove their stone from the first property first.
