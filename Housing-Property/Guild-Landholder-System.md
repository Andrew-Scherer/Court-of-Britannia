# ⚖️ Guild Landholder System

**One Property. One Person. Living Land.**

---

## Core Principle

Every property is anchored to a **single living character**. Guilds exist through people, not abstractions. This ensures permadeath always matters and land never becomes immortal.

## The One Property Rule

**Every character may own exactly one property.** This applies to all property types: city homes, historic sites, keeps, forts, guild halls. No exceptions.

## Guild Landholdership

A **Guild Landholder** is the individual who binds property to a guild by placing a guildstone on it.

The Guild Landholder:
- Is the legal anchor of the property
- Bears the risk of death, defection, or disappearance
- May also be the guild leader, but not necessarily

**Guild Leader vs Guild Landholder:** These are separate roles. Leadership can rotate safely while land ownership provides institutional continuity. They may be the same person but don't have to be.

## Co-Ownership

Properties may have co-owners or residents who share access and permissions. **Co-owners do not anchor land—only the Guild Landholder does.**

## Guild Landholder Death or Departure

When a Guild Landholder dies (permadeath) or leaves the guild:
- The property enters **Interregnum**
- The guildstone remains active
- Guild activity continues but major actions are restricted

## Interregnum Resolution

**Priority Window (48 hours):** Co-owner guild members have first right to become Guild Landholder.

**After 48 hours:** Any guild member who owns no other property may bind themselves as Guild Landholder at the guildstone.

**Failure to resolve:**
- After 24 hours: Bank access suspended, upkeep penalties doubled
- After 48 hours: Upkeep penalties tripled, decorations decay
- After 7 days: Guildstone decays, property returns to public auction

## Why This System Exists

**Guilds do not die. People do.** If land belonged directly to guilds, death would lose meaning and maps would ossify. Guild Landholdership ensures every property is mortal and every institution rests on flesh.

By separating guild leadership from land ownership:
- Leadership can change without risking land
- Land can change without collapsing leadership
- Risk is localized, not totalized

> Land should outlive leaders—but not people.
