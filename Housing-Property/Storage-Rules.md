**Where Items Live, How They Decay, and How They Are Lost.**

## 1. The Golden Rule: Housing Is a Link
Physical houses are NOT storage containers. They are **conduits**.
*   **Guild Bank Link**: Your house allows access to your **Guild Bank**.
    *   *Example:* A guild member in their guildhall can access the guild's shared bank.
    *   *Example:* A guild member in any guild-owned property can access their guild bank.
*   **Personal Storage**: Players without guild property must use the **Britain Bank** for gold and the **[Inn Starter Bank](../City-Services/Inn-Storage.md)** for temporary item storage (3-day grace period for new players).

## 2. Guild Collapse Risk (The "Doom" Mechanic)
Your banked items are only as safe as the guild that holds them.
*   **If a Guild is Disbanded**: All contents of its Guild Bank are **LOST**.
*   **Political Fate**: Guild members are financially bound to maintain their guild. If the guild collapses, you lose your stored wealth.

## 3. Warm Storage (The "Drift" Allowance)
While high-value loot goes to the Bank, houses allow limited **Warm Storage** for decoration and daily utility.

### Permitted Items
*   **Furniture**: Tables, chairs, beds (Must be locked down).
*   **Trophies**: Heads, banners, rare art (Must be locked down).
*   **Crafting Tools**: Looms, forges, anvils (Must be locked down).
*   **Utility**: Runebooks, Lanterns.
*   **Low-Value Supply**: Food, Drink, Reagents (Small quantities).

### Forbidden Items (The "Cold Storage" Mandate)
*   **High-Value Loot**: Magic weapons, armor, artifacts.
*   **Bulk Commodities**: Ingots (1000+), Timber, Leather.
*   **Gold**: Cannot be stored in houses (must be in Bank or Inventory).

### Mechanics
*   **Decay**: Items not "Locked Down" decay in 1 hour.
*   **Lockdowns**: Limited by house size.
*   **Theft**: Warm Storage items are **visible** and potentially **stealable** if not secured properly (e.g. public access settings).
