# 🏠 Housing Is Not Storage

**Houses Are About Place, Not Vaults**

---


## The Core Conclusion


> Houses are not vaults.They are places to live.

Housing does not function as static storage.

Players cannot use housing for:


- Permanent storage of secured containers
- Lockdowns that persist indefinitely
- Hoarding mechanisms
- Insulating progress from risk


## What This Removes

Traditional housing storage creates:


- **Hoarding Anxiety** — Fear of losing accumulated items creates paranoia and defensiveness
- **Lock/Permission Micromanagement** — Complex trust systems and access control become necessary
- **Shell-Guild Storage Exploits** — Players fragment into single-person guilds to maximize storage
- **Housing-as-Entrenchment Gameplay** — Power accumulates behind walls instead of in the world

By removing housing storage, you eliminate all of these problems.


## Housing Grants Access, Not Ownership


> **Note**
> **How It Works**
>
> Living in a building grants **access to your global bank box**, not ownership of storage containers.
> **Residency → Access to banking services**

Personal items are stored through the **banking system**.

Storage is:


- **Individual** — Each player has their own bank box
- **Private** — No one else can access your items
- **Abstracted** — Not tied to the building itself


## Why This Works

This design allows:


- Shared housing without forced trust
- Cohabitation without theft risk
- Political loss without inventory wipeouts
- Multiple residents without permission complexity
- Cooperation without vulnerability


## What You CAN Do With Housing


> **Note**
> **Expression, Not Storage**
>
> While housing doesn't provide storage, it still allows:
> - **Decoration** — Free access to decorative items
> - **Furniture placement** — Chairs, tables, beds, ambiance
> - **Vendors** — Player-controlled merchants
> - **Social gathering** — A place to meet and roleplay
> - **Political presence** — Visible claim to space

Housing is about **where you are**, not **what you own**.


## The Shift in Mindset


> **❗ Note**

The answer:


> A house is:A place in the worldA social hubA statement of identityA political anchorAccess to banking services

Once players adapt, they realize:


- Less anxiety about loss
- No paranoia about theft
- More willingness to invite others
- Cleaner political conflict
- Less attachment to buildings, more attachment to people


## How This Supports Politics

When housing is divorced from storage:


- **Loss becomes fair** — Losing a property hurts politically, not personally
- **Cooperation increases** — No need to create shell guilds for storage
- **Conflict stays social** — Fights are about territory, not loot
- **Recovery is faster** — Players re-engage instead of quitting after loss


> Housing becomes a stage for politics,not a vault for accumulation.


## The Sacred Line

This rule must be absolute:


> **Note**
> **If It Affects Power, It's Not In A House**
>
> Power-affecting items are stored in banks.
> Houses are for presence, expression, and access.
> That line keeps the system clean.
