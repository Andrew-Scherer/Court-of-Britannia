# 🏠 Housing Is Not Storage

**Houses Are About Place, Not Vaults**

---

## Core Concept

Housing does not function as storage. Players cannot lock down containers, secure items, or use houses as vaults.

Instead, **living in a building grants access to your global bank box**—the same banking system available at banks throughout the realm.

## Why This Design

Removing housing storage eliminates:

- **Hoarding anxiety** — No fear of losing accumulated items when property changes hands
- **Shell-guild exploits** — No incentive to fragment into single-person guilds for storage
- **Permission complexity** — No need for lockdown/access control micromanagement
- **Theft paranoia** — Residents can cohabitate without trusting each other with their possessions

## What Housing Provides

- **Bank access** — Residents can access their personal bank box while in the building
- **Decoration** — Free cosmetic expression
- **Vendors** — Player-controlled merchants
- **Social space** — A place to gather and roleplay
- **Political presence** — Visible claim to territory

## Result

Housing becomes about **where you are**, not **what you own**. Property loss is political, not personal. Players cooperate without vulnerability. Conflict stays social, not inventory-based.

> **If it affects power, it's stored in banks—not houses.**
