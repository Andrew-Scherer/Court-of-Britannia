# 🏠 Housing Philosophy

**"Where You Stand in the World, Not What You Hide Behind Walls"**

---

## The Core Concept

Housing on *Kingdoms of Britannia* is fundamentally different from traditional Ultima Online. It is designed to foster **politics, community, and conflict**, rather than isolation and hoarding.

> **The Golden Rule:**
> **Housing is for Roleplay. Banks are for Storage.**

## 1. Housing Is Not Storage

In standard UO, houses are vaults. This creates "hoarding anxiety"—the fear that if you lose your house, you lose your progress. This leads to defensive play, shell guilds, and risk aversion.

**On this shard:**
*   **You cannot secure containers in houses.**
*   **You access your GUILD BANK from guild-owned property.**
*   **Your loot safety depends on the Guild's survival.**

### The Result
Since there is no loot to steal *at the house location*, **you don't need to trust your roommates.** You can share a house with rivals, strangers, or guildmates. However, you share a **political fate**—if the guild you are part of disbands, you all lose access to the guild bank.

## 2. Encouraging Shared Housing

Because storage is guild-based (Guild Bank) and not house-based (Secure Chests), we eliminate the need for "Shell Guilds" (1-man guilds created just to own a dedicated storage house).

*   **Co-Habitation is Safe**: 10 players can live in one Fort. Each guild member uses the shared guild bank.
*   **One Property Per Guild**: Guilds are encouraged to fight for **one major property** (e.g., The Orc Fort, The Lighthouse).
*   **Guild Economy**: Guild members share access to the guild bank through guild-owned property.

*   **Loss is Playable**: Since your items are in the bank, being evicted is a dramatic roleplay event (scandal, disgrace), not a "quit moment" (loss of all assets).

## 4. The Dual Property Model

Property in Britannia is split by **Zone of Authority**:

- **Civic Property (Britain)**: Under the [Land Commissioner]. Tenure is a privilege granted by the Crown. Subject to eviction for harboring and residency laws.
- **Territorial Property (Wilderness)**: Under Guild control. Maintenance is an economic condition ([Upkeep]). Subject to political outlawry, but not mechanical eviction.

## Summary Comparison

| Feature | Standard UO | Kingdoms of Britannia |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Storage** | Secure Chests in House | Guild Bank (Accessed via Guild Property) |
| **Theft Risk** | High (if friended) | Political (Guild Collapse = Loss) |
| **Roommates** | Dangerous (Trust required) | Safe (No direct asset access) |
| **Eviction** | Impossible (Permanent ownership) | Political (72h Notice, Role loss) |
| **Purpose** | Hoarding Assets | Social High Ground |
