# 🏰 Property System

**Occupy History, Build Your Chapter**

---

## Core Concept

**There are no housing deeds.** Players cannot place pre-fabricated houses on empty land. Britannia's major structures—cities, forts, keeps, monasteries—already exist as permanent world fixtures.

**But players can build.** Using [[Carpentry Parts|Carpentry-Building-Parts]] and guild Builder permissions, players construct custom additions, modify existing structures, and expand claimed territories.

> You don't place a deed.  
> You occupy a fort and build onto it.

## What Are Historic Properties?

Historic properties are **permanent world fixtures**—iconic locations that exist on the map at server start:

- Orc Forts
- Pirate Coves and Smuggler Havens
- Undead Keeps and Ruined Strongholds
- Remote Monasteries or Cult Sites
- Bandit Camps and Rebel Outposts
- City buildings and residences

**The property is permanent. Occupation is temporary.** Historic sites outlive all guilds.

## How Ownership Works

Historic properties are sold through **open public auction**:

- Anyone may bid
- All bids are visible
- The highest bidder wins control
- Winner establishes presence by **placing a guildstone** within the territory
- Upkeep begins immediately

### Claiming Process

After winning an auction, the guild has a limited window to establish occupation:

- A guild officer interacts with the **property sign** at the site
- The system validates the auction win and active claim window
- Upon confirmation, a **guildstone is automatically placed** within the property
- The guild now controls the territory

**Claims belong to guilds, deaths belong to individuals.** If an officer dies while claiming, another can complete it. The claim window continues.

If the claim isn't completed in time, the property returns to auction.

## One Guild, One Historic Property

A guild may only hold **one historic property at a time**. This prevents empire-building and forces meaningful choices.

**Automatic Relinquishment:** If a guild wins a new property while holding another, their old property is immediately relinquished when they claim the new one. The old guildstone is removed and the property returns to auction at 1 gold starting bid.

## Custom Construction

While major structures are fixed, **players can build custom additions**:

### What Players Cannot Do

- Place housing deeds
- Drop pre-fabricated houses
- Claim fresh plots for custom housing

### What Players Can Do

- **Build custom additions** — Use Carpentry Parts to construct walls, floors, towers, extensions
- **Modify existing spaces** — Expand rooms, add wings, create custom layouts  
- **Construct on guild property** — Builders with proper permissions craft unique architecture

**Fixed major structures ensure:**
- Geography is finite and contested
- Landmarks remain recognizable
- Political boundaries have meaning

**Custom construction ensures:**
- Player expression and creativity
- Guild identity through unique architecture
- Strategic fortification and expansion
- Evolving settlements

> The Orc Fort is permanent.  
> What you build inside and around it is yours.

## When Guilds Collapse

If a guild disbands or fails upkeep:

- The guildstone is removed
- Control reverts to the world
- The site automatically returns to **public auction** at 1 gold starting bid
- **The property persists**—buildings remain, walls endure

Custom player construction may decay or be removed, but the historic structure itself remains permanent.

## Identity Through Commitment

There are **no theme restrictions**. An Orc Fort isn't "for orcs" because the system says so—it becomes one because:

- Orc-aligned players value it more
- They pool gold to win it
- They accept upkeep burden
- They defend it

If the "wrong" group occupies it, that's not a problem—**that's content.** Either they hold it by force and narrative, or lose it economically or violently.

## Upkeep Is the Gatekeeper

Historic sites carry higher upkeep costs relative to their value and significance. They attract attention, rivals, and scrutiny.

Only organized, invested groups survive long-term. Inactive ownership collapses naturally without admin intervention.

## Crown Recognition

Owning a historic site does not grant legitimacy by default. **The Crown decides legitimacy, not ownership.**

The Crown may:
- Recognize the guild as lawful authority
- Tolerate them without endorsement
- Outlaw them as rebels or criminals

Recognition is **political**, affecting trade access, legal standing, and narrative framing—but not who controls the land. Gold and survival determine that.

## The Result

You inherit history, then write your chapter on it. The fort existed before you. It will exist after you. But while it's yours, you shape it.

Historic sites become living spaces that evolve with each occupation, accumulating layers of construction and destruction, creating visible history.

**Places are permanent. Guilds are temporary. Power is inherited through occupation and construction, not deed placement.**
