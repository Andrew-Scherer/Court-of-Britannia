# 🏛️ City vs Historic Property

**Safety Through Law vs Influence Through Risk**

---


## Two Kinds of Space


> Britannia does not rank these spaces.It distinguishes them.

One offers safety through law.  

        The other offers influence through risk.


## City Property: The Safety Valve


> **Note**
> **Cities Exist So Individuals Can Live Safely**
>
> Not everyone wants to hold a fort.  
> 
>             Not everyone needs political visibility.  
> 
>             Not everyone seeks influence zones.
> Cities provide an alternative.


### Inside City Limits

Property within Britain's walls offers:


- **Guard Response** — Violence is punished
- **Law Exists** — Rules are enforced
- **Quiet Living Is Viable** — You can craft, trade, socialize in peace
- **Small-Scale Housing Works** — Individuals and small groups thrive here

This makes cities ideal for:


- Merchants who want safe vendor spaces
- Crafters who need stability
- Diplomats who operate neutrally
- Small friend groups who don't want guild obligations
- New players learning the systems


## Historic Property: Dangerous by Design


> Major housing outside citiesis not meant for individuals.

Historic properties favor groups **naturally**.

Solo or small groups can **attempt** it.

But:


- Scale is tested continuously
- Presence must be maintained
- Attention becomes a burden


### Outside City Limits

Historic properties demand:


- **Power Must Be Defended** — No guards will save you
- **Presence Must Be Maintained** — Absence invites claims
- **Silence Invites Pressure** — Inactivity looks like weakness

This is enforced by:


- Visibility — Everyone knows where you are
- Upkeep — Economic pressure is constant
- Political attention — Rivals watch for weakness
- Human limits — Time, attention, coordination

**Not** by:


- Hard restrictions
- Timers or activity checks
- Mechanical enforcement


> **Note**
> **Natural Selection, Not Artificial Gates**
>
> The system doesn't *forbid* solo players from taking forts.
> It simply tests whether they can hold them.
> Most cannot. Some do. Both stories are valid.


## The Gradient Is Natural

This creates a **risk gradient**, not artificial tiers.


> Distance from Britain = Distance from safety

As you move away from city walls:


- Guard response fades
- Law becomes optional
- Power becomes self-enforced
- Political stakes increase

This isn't a binary switch.  

        It's a **spectrum**.


## Why Both Matter


### Without City Property

If only historic properties existed:


- New players have nowhere safe to start
- Small groups are excluded
- Merchants have no stable trade zones
- The world becomes hostile-only


### Without Historic Property

If only city property existed:


- All housing is safe and generic
- No territorial conflict over meaningful sites
- Guilds have no clear identity markers
- The world becomes safe-only


### With Both

The system allows:


- New players to live safely in cities
- Organized groups to claim historic sites
- Merchants to operate under law
- Guilds to compete for visible power
- Players to **choose their risk level**


## This Is Not A Hierarchy

City property is not "worse" than historic property.

They serve **different purposes**.


> **Note**
> **Different Goals, Different Spaces**
>
> **Do you want safety?** → City property
> **Do you want political influence?** → Historic property
> **Do you want to be visible?** → Historic property
> **Do you want to be left alone?** → City property

Neither is "better."  

        Both are necessary.


## Britannia Does Not Forbid Risk

A solo player can bid on a fort.

A small group can claim a keep.

The system doesn't stop them.


> Britannia does not forbid solitary claimants.It simply tests whether they can survive what they have taken.

If you can:


- Pay the upkeep
- Defend your claim socially or militarily
- Maintain presence against rivals
- Endure the pressure

Then the fort is yours.

If you can't, it returns to auction.

**The world decides. Not an arbitrary rule.**
