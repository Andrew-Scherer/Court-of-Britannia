# 🏰 Historic Property

**Permanence of Place, Temporariness of Power**

---


> *Britannia is old. Long before players arrived, certain places already mattered—orc forts carved into hillsides, pirate coves hidden along the coast, forgotten keeps, ruined monasteries, bandit camps, ancient halls, and strongholds no Crown ever fully tamed.*

These locations are not set dressing.  

        They are **historic sites of power**.

This system exists to answer one simple question:

**Who gets to claim them—and why?**

The answer is not lore.  

        The answer is not admin assignment.  

        The answer is **commitment**.


## What Are Historic Properties?

Historic properties are **permanent world fixtures**—iconic locations that already exist on the map at server start.

**Examples include:**


- Orc Forts
- Pirate Coves and Smuggler Havens
- Undead Keeps and Ruined Strongholds
- Remote Monasteries or Cult Sites
- Bandit Camps and Rebel Outposts
- Prestigious or Unique Buildings with historical weight


> **Note**
> **Critical Distinction**
>
> **The property is permanent.**  
> 
> **Occupation is temporary.**
> Historic sites outlive all guilds.  
> 
>             Guilds are temporary occupants.  
> 
>             The world does not forget.


## Britannia Is Not Empty Land


> **❗ Note**
> There are no housing deeds.
> There is no free-placement construction.
> Players do not create new structures.

This is intentional.

**Britannia is not empty land waiting to be filled.**

Players move into history. They do not redraw it.

Every place worth holding already exists:


- Existing buildings on the world map
- Historic properties (forts, keeps, coves, monasteries, ruins)
- Camps, tents, or temporary structures embedded in the world
- Fixed, world-embedded locations


> Power comes from occupying meaningful locations.Not from creating new ones.

**Geography is finite and contested.**

There is:


- No free-placement housing
- No custom plot claiming
- No deed-based house construction

All residency is **location-based**, not blueprint-based.

Properties are acquired through **public auction** when they become vacant.

This gives every guild a chance to pool funds and compete for a location.

**Guilds can occupy only a single location at once.**

You do not build a fort.  

**You win one at auction.**

You do not construct a keep.  

**You bid for one.**

You do not place a house.  

**You acquire one.**


## How Ownership Works

Historic properties are sold through **open public auction**.


- Anyone may bid
- All bids are visible
- The highest bidder wins control of the property
- The winner must establish guild presence by **placing a guildstone** within the purchased territory
- Upkeep begins immediately


> **❗ Note**
> You buy control of an existing property.
> You bring your own guildstone and place it within the territory you now control.
> The guildstone marks your occupation—it does not create the property.

**Guildstones mark occupation:**


- Player-created
- Player-placed
- Guild-owned

Once occupation is established, players may furnish, decorate, and operate the property as traditional home ownership allows—placing vendors, furniture, and other objects within the space they control.

**Historic sites themselves are:**


- Permanent world fixtures
- Independent of any guild's existence
- Continuously contestable

The guildstone is a marker of occupation, not construction.


## Claiming Is a Process, Not a Moment

Winning an auction does not instantly secure a historic property. It grants a **guild** the right to claim it.

After an auction concludes, the winning guild has a limited window to establish occupation by placing a guildstone within the territory. During this time, the location remains dangerous and contested — **deaths may delay the claim, but they do not invalidate it**.


> **Note**
> **Claims Belong to Guilds, Deaths Belong to Individuals**
>
> Historic property claims cannot be attached to a single mortal body.
> **Claims belong to guilds.
>             Deaths belong to individuals.**
> If a guild officer is killed while attempting to claim a property, the claim window continues. Another officer may complete the claim. The guild does not lose its right to the property simply because one member died.
> This ensures that historic sites are taken by **organization and persistence**, not by timing or grief.

If the claim is not completed within the window, the property returns to public auction.


### Property Sign Interaction, Not Guildstone Hauling

To establish occupation, a guild officer does not physically drag a guildstone across contested territory.

Instead:


- A property sign exists at or near the historic site
- A guild officer (with appropriate permissions) interacts with the sign
- The system validates that the guild won the auction and the claim window is active
- Upon confirmation, a guildstone is **automatically placed** within the property

This removes the logistical burden of guildstone transport while preserving the danger of the claim process. Officers must still reach the site, survive long enough to interact with the sign, and complete the claim under pressure.

**The risk remains. The tedium is removed.**


## One Guild, One Historic Property

A guild may only hold **one historic property at a time**.

This limitation is absolute. A guild cannot bid on, win, or claim a second historic property while already occupying one.


> **Note**
> **Why This Matters**
>
> This rule prevents empire-building through property hoarding.
> It forces meaningful choices:
> - Do you hold the Orc Fort for its defensive position?
> - Or abandon it to claim the Pirate Cove for its trade routes?
> - Do you keep the remote monastery?
> - Or compete for the prestigious keep?
> Guilds cannot accumulate historic sites like trophies. They must choose one and defend it.


### Automatic Relinquishment

If a guild currently occupying a historic property wins the auction for a different historic property, their existing property is **automatically relinquished** when they claim the new one.

The moment the guild officer interacts with the new property sign:


- The old guildstone is removed
- The previous property reverts to the world
- It is immediately listed for public auction at 1 gold starting bid

This ensures:


- No manual admin intervention required
- No exploitation through timing gaps
- Clean, immediate transitions
- Properties return to circulation instantly


> You cannot hold two forts.You cannot stockpile keeps.You choose one legacy at a time.


## Shell Guilds Don't Work

The Crown does not track guilds as abstract entities.

**The Crown tracks people.**

Recognition, standing, liens, seizure risk, and legal accountability are attached to **individuals**, not guild tags.


> **❗ Note**
> If the same group of individuals operates multiple guilds:
> - The Crown recognizes the pattern
> - Recognition is withheld or revoked
> - Liens may be applied across all properties
> - Legal standing collapses

Britannia is not fooled by shell organizations.

The system recognizes:


- Guild leadership
- Active membership
- Overlapping rosters
- Coordinated bidding patterns

If you attempt to operate multiple guilds to claim multiple historic properties, you do not gain an empire. You gain vulnerability.

**Recognition tracks people, not banners.**


## What Happens When a Guild Collapses?

If the owning guild disbands, collapses, or fails to pay upkeep:


> **Note**
> **The Property Persists**
>
> The historic site **does NOT disappear**.
> Instead:
> - The guildstone is removed
> - Control reverts to the world
> - The site is automatically returned to **public auction**
> - The starting bid is **1 gold**
> **History persists even when banners fall.**

The buildings remain.  

        The walls endure.  

        The geography does not change.

This ensures:


- No admin cleanup required
- No historical erasure
- Continuous contestation
- The world remembers what guilds forget


> Guilds are temporary.Places are permanent.Power is inherited through occupation, not construction.


## Identity Emerges From Commitment

There are **no theme restrictions**, no racial locks, no roleplay enforcement.


> If you want it, you pay for it.If you can't afford to keep it, you lose it.

An Orc Fort is not "for orcs" because the system says so.  

        It becomes an Orc Fort because:


- Orc-aligned players value it more
- They are willing to pool gold
- They accept the upkeep burden
- They are ready to defend it socially and militarily

The system doesn't force orcs into the fort.  

        It simply lets the people who care most win.

**Ownership is determined by:**


- Willingness to pay
- Willingness to organize
- Willingness to endure upkeep and pressure
- Willingness to defend what you occupy


## What If the "Wrong" Group Occupies It?

That's not a problem.  

**That's content.**

If a human merchant guild occupies an Orc Fort:


- Orc players now have a clear enemy
- The guild must justify its presence
- Recognition may be denied
- Trade may become dangerous
- Upkeep pressure increases under hostility

Either the guild:


- Holds it by force and narrative ("We conquered this place")
- Or loses it economically or violently

**Both outcomes are valid.
        Both create stories.**


> **❗ Note**
> Players do.


## Upkeep Is the Real Gatekeeper

Historic sites are not cheap trophies.

They:


- Have higher assessed value
- Carry higher daily upkeep
- Attract attention, rivals, and scrutiny
- Paint a target on their owners

This ensures:


- Inactive ownership collapses naturally
- Theme squatters fail quickly
- Only organized, invested groups survive long-term


> If you cannot sustain the cost, the land returns to the world.No admin cleanup.No zombie guilds.No stagnation.


## Scale Matters

Not all historic properties are equal. Some locations are small, quiet, and easily held. Others are famous, valuable, and watched.

The larger and more significant a site is, the more pressure it attracts — economically, politically, and militarily. Holding such places requires coordination, presence, and endurance over time.

Britannia does not forbid solitary claimants. It simply tests whether they can survive what they have taken.


## City Property vs Historic Property

Property within Britain's city limits exists under law. Guards respond, violence has consequences, and stability is the norm. These locations are suited for individuals and small groups who wish to live, trade, and operate within protection.

Historic properties exist beyond that protection. They are visible, valuable, and contested. Holding them requires organization, defense, and endurance over time. Recognition is not assumed, and power is never secure.

Britannia does not rank these spaces. It distinguishes them. One offers safety through law. The other offers influence through risk.


## Crown Recognition: Political, Not Mechanical

Owning a historic site does not grant legitimacy by default.


> **Note**
> **The Crown Does Not Decide Ownership**
>
> **The Crown decides legitimacy.**
> That distinction is everything.

The Crown may:


- Recognize the occupying guild as lawful authority
- Tolerate them without endorsement
- Outlaw them as rebels, criminals, or pretenders

Recognition is **political, not mechanical**.

Recognition affects:


- Trade access
- Legal standing
- Liens and seizure risk
- Narrative framing

But recognition does not determine who controls land.  

**Gold and survival do.**


## Why This System Works

This design solves several problems at once:


- No admin lore policing
- No forced roleplay
- No permanent land squatting
- No historical erasure when guilds fail
- No zombie properties
- No sprawling custom housing

And it creates:


- Market-driven identity
- Earned legitimacy
- Automatic conflict generation
- Clean failure states
- Player-authored history
- World memory that persists beyond individual guilds
- Finite, contested geography


> Power flows from:Gold → Occupation → Defense → RecognitionNot from construction or customization.


## The Core Philosophy

Historic places do not belong to races, factions, or themes.

They belong to:


- Those willing to pay
- Those willing to organize
- Those willing to endure pressure
- Those willing to defend occupation


> If you want to be orcs—occupy the fort.If you want to be pirates—hold the cove.If you want to be rebels—survive without recognition.

Britannia does not ask who you are.  

**It watches what you can hold.**

**Every place worth holding already exists.**


## The World Does Not Forget

Every historic property has outlived countless guilds.

When your guild falls:


- Your guildstone is removed
- Your banner is forgotten
- Your wealth is scattered

But the fort remains.  

        The cove endures.  

        The keep waits.

**The world does not forget.**

Another guild will come.  

        Another banner will rise.  

        Another story will begin.

The stone walls do not care who occupied them before.  

        The ancient halls remember no loyalties.


> *The land does not care who you claim to be.Only who pays for it.Only who defends it.Only who is remembered.*


## Summary

Historic properties are permanent world fixtures that guilds temporarily occupy. They are sold via public auction, and winning bidders establish control by placing a guildstone within the purchased territory.

Custom house placement is disabled. Players cannot create new structures. All residency is location-based—players occupy existing buildings, not construct new ones.

When guilds collapse or fail upkeep, the guildstone is removed and the property returns to auction at 1 gold starting bid. The site persists. History persists. The world does not forget.

Ownership is determined by commitment—willingness to pay, organize, defend, and endure—not by theme, race, or lore. The Crown recognizes legitimacy, not ownership. Recognition is political.

**Places are permanent. Guilds are temporary. Power is inherited through occupation, not construction.**
