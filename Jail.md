# 🔒 Jail System

**Custody, Timers, and Political Resolution**

---


## Jail as Custody, Not Sentencing

Jail is temporary custody. Custody begins automatically upon lawful arrest. Custody does not require a sentence. Custody resolves automatically via timers.

Custody is not punishment. Custody is not resolution. Custody creates time for political or legal intervention.


## Baseline Custody Classes

When a character is jailed, they are assigned a Custody Class with a default timer.


| Custody Class | Example Crimes | Baseline Hold |
|---|---|---|
| Minor | Theft, disorder, trespass | 10–15 minutes |
| Serious | Assault, repeat offenses, obstruction | 1–3 hours |
| Capital | Murder, treason, regicide attempt | 12–24 hours |

No human action is required. No trial is required. No judgment is required. Timers always tick, even if no one is online.


## Absolute Rule: Custody Always Ends


> **❗ Note**

There are no exceptions. Prisoners are never permanently trapped. The system does not stall play.


## Guard Release Authority (Limited)

Guards have limited authority to release prisoners.


### Guards MAY:


- Release prisoners they personally arrested
- Only within a short window (15–30 minutes)
- Only before trial or escalation


### Guards MAY NOT:


- Release prisoners after trial
- Release prisoners under sentence
- Release political detainees without higher authority

All releases are logged and public. This is error correction, not mercy.


## Auto-Release for Capital Custody

When capital custody expires without intervention, the prisoner is released automatically.

This is not mercy. This represents institutional failure.


### Consequence A: Execution Eligibility Persists


- Death sentence may still be issued later
- Arrest warrants remain valid (see [[Bounty System|Bounty]])
- Capture and execution can occur later


### Consequence B: Property & Role Fallout


- Crown may evict from royal property
- Offices may be vacated or challenged


### Consequence C: Public Mark

Arrest record updates: "Released due to unresolved custody."

Legitimacy damage becomes visible.


## Where Human Authority Enters

Human roles do not keep the system running. They only change outcomes.


| Role | Authority |
|---|---|
| Magistrate | Escalate custody to executionDowngrade chargesDeclare arrest unlawfulOrder release |
| King | PardonCommuteExileAccelerate execution |
| Guards | Correct their own mistakes (short window)Re-arrest on new causeTransfer custody |
| Warden | Modify conditions onlySeparate prisonersRecommend outcomesNever block release or visitation |


## What Happens If No One Is Online

Prisoners remain jailed. Timers continue. Custody resolves. Consequences fire. Records update.

When players return, they respond to what happened. They do not decide whether it was allowed to happen.


## Jail Is Not a Court Simulator


- 80% of arrests auto-resolve
- 15% become political leverage
- 5% become major cases

Magistrates only engage with contested arrests, high-profile prisoners, and power struggles.

No routine trials. No mandatory reviews. No administrative backlog.


## Entry into Custody

Custody begins when a prisoner is formally delivered to the jail following lawful arrest.

The Jail System does not define how arrests occur or how individuals are subdued prior to delivery.

> **See:** [[Death & Downed States|Permadeath-Downed]] for subdue and capture mechanics


## Conditions of Custody

Prisoners are confined to cells. Group or individual holding cells. Prisoners are not allowed to kill each other in jail. Prisoners cannot leave custody on their own authority.

Logging out does not remove imprisonment. When a prisoner logs back in, they remain in custody until the timer expires or authority intervenes.


## Prisoner Agency While Confined

Agency does not require freedom.

While jailed, a prisoner can:


- Declare cooperation
- Refuse all comment
- Demand trial
- Petition a specific authority
- Publicly accuse someone
- Offer ransom or exchange

None of these do anything mechanically. But all of them trigger attention, change narratives, and create pressure.


## Jail as a Place Where Deals Happen

Players stay logged in when negotiation is live.


### Ransom & Exchange Visibility

The Warden can mark a prisoner as "Negotiable."

This signals that deals are possible. Others know they can approach.

Effect: People show up to talk.


## Execution from Custody

Jailed prisoners may be executed only after lawful sentencing. Only the Executioner may perform executions. Guards may not execute prisoners in custody.


> **Note**
> **See:** [[Execution Mechanics|Execution-Mechanics]] for full procedural details
> **See:** [[The Executioner|Executioner]] for role authority


## Records

All imprisonments are recorded. Records include who ordered custody, charges stated, duration, and outcome. Records are accessible to Magistrates and the Crown.


## System Summary

Custody is automatic. Custody is temporary. Custody resolves through timers. Human authority changes outcomes but does not keep the system running. No player can be permanently trapped due to absence.
