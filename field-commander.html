        <h2>What a Captain of the Crown Is</h2>
        
        <div class="quote">
            Captain of the Crowns control regions, not units. They are governors with armies, far from oversight and close to power.
        </div>
        
        <p>While the Lord of the Royal Army sets strategy from Britain, Captains of the Crown execute it in the field. They operate in protectorates, borderlands, and hostile territories where civilian authority does not reach and military judgment is immediate.</p>
        
        <p>This distance creates both operational necessity and political danger.</p>
        
        <h2>Authority and Position</h2>
        
        <p>Captain of the Crowns hold mid-tier military command. They:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are appointed by the Lord of the Royal Army</li>
            <li>Command specific regions, borders, or theaters</li>
            <li>Appoint officers and organize soldiers under their command</li>
            <li>Act with the authority of the Lord of the Royal Army when distant from Britain</li>
            <li>Report to the Lord of the Royal Army but make autonomous decisions in the field</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Appointment Limits</h3>
            <p><strong>Maximum: 3 Captain of the Crowns</strong></p>
            <p>This limitation prevents fragmentation of military command while ensuring sufficient coverage for multiple theaters of operation. In practice, it also prevents any single Captain of the Crown from believing they control the entire military.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Core Duties</h2>
        
        <p>Captain of the Crowns are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Regional control</strong> — Maintaining military presence in assigned territories</li>
            <li><strong>Force composition</strong> — Recruiting, training, and organizing soldiers</li>
            <li><strong>Tactical command</strong> — Leading engagements, sieges, and patrols</li>
            <li><strong>Strategic assessment</strong> — Reporting on threats, opportunities, and resource needs</li>
            <li><strong>Garrison management</strong> — Maintaining forts, camps, and supply lines</li>
            <li><strong>Local diplomacy</strong> — Negotiating with faction leaders in their region</li>
            <li><strong>Officer appointments</strong> — Selecting unit leaders and delegating authority</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Unlike City Guards who arrest, or Lord of the Royal Armys who plan campaigns, Captain of the Crowns <strong>hold territory</strong>. They make Britain's presence permanent in places where it would otherwise disappear.</p>
        
        <h2>Regional Autonomy</h2>
        
        <p>Captains of the Crown operate far from Britain, often beyond effective communication or oversight. This distance creates a gray zone where orders from the Lord of the Royal Army or Crown may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arrive too late to be relevant</li>
            <li>Contradict local realities</li>
            <li>Be ignored due to "field necessity"</li>
            <li>Be reinterpreted to fit Captain of the Crown priorities</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="quote-simple">
            "The order said secure the region. I did. The methods were my choice."
        </div>
        
        <p>This autonomy is both necessary and exploited. A Captain of the Crown who waits for permission in a crisis fails their duty. A Captain of the Crown who acts without constraint becomes a warlord.</p>
        
        <h3>Decision-Making in the Field</h3>
        
        <p>When separated from Britain, Captain of the Crowns must decide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whether to engage a threat or withdraw</li>
            <li>When to escalate force or show restraint</li>
            <li>Which factions to negotiate with and which to destroy</li>
            <li>How to allocate limited supplies and reinforcements</li>
            <li>Whether to obey orders that seem outdated or counterproductive</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These decisions create loyalty networks: soldiers follow Captain of the Crowns who keep them alive and reward them. Over time, soldiers obey the Captain of the Crown before the Crown.</p>
        
        <h2>Relationship With the Lord of the Royal Army</h2>
        
        <p>Captain of the Crowns answer to the Lord of the Royal Army, but in practice that relationship is complex:</p>
        
        <h3>Normal State: Cooperation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lord of the Royal Army sets overall strategy</li>
            <li>Captain of the Crowns execute it regionally</li>
            <li>Reports flow upward; orders flow downward</li>
            <li>Disagreements are resolved through negotiation or recall</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Tension State: Competing Priorities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Captain of the Crown claims regional knowledge justifies deviation from strategy</li>
            <li>Lord of the Royal Army sees insubordination</li>
            <li>Each blames the other for failures</li>
            <li>Soldiers caught between conflicting loyalties</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Crisis State: Open Defiance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Captain of the Crown refuses recall</li>
            <li>Captain of the Crown claims Lord of the Royal Army is incompetent or traitorous</li>
            <li>Captain of the Crown declares independent authority "for Britain's good"</li>
            <li>Other Captain of the Crowns must choose sides</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Captain of the Crowns are the most common source of military coups.</strong>
            <p>They command hardened veterans. They operate beyond oversight. They build personal loyalty networks. And they believe their judgment in the field is superior to civilian or distant military leadership.</p>
            <p>History proves them right often enough to be dangerous.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Relationship With Soldiers</h2>
        
        <p>Soldiers follow Captain of the Crowns because:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Captain of the Crowns appoint and promote them</li>
            <li>Captain of the Crowns keep them alive in combat</li>
            <li>Captain of the Crowns secure supplies, pay, and rest</li>
            <li>Captain of the Crowns share the same dangers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This creates <strong>vertical loyalty</strong> — soldiers obey Captain of the Crowns immediately and the Crown theoretically. When conflict arises, soldiers follow who they trust and who controls their daily survival.</p>
        
        <h3>Loyalty Networks in Practice</h3>
        
        <p>A Captain of the Crown with 20 hardened soldiers under their direct command controls:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A military force capable of defeating most civilian threats</li>
            <li>The ability to hold territory against rival claimants</li>
            <li>Leverage in succession disputes</li>
            <li>Bargaining power with the Crown</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If three Captain of the Crowns align, they control Britain's external military. If they fracture, Britain's external position collapses.</p>
        
        <h2>Political Power and Ambition</h2>
        
        <p>Captain of the Crowns occupy a unique political position:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They command violence but are not the ultimate military authority</li>
            <li>They operate far from Britain but represent Crown interests</li>
            <li>They build regional power bases that rival the capital</li>
            <li>They become indispensable to Britain's security—and thus difficult to remove</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Political Leverage</h3>
        
        <p>A Captain of the Crown can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Withhold reports</strong> — Claim threats are greater or lesser than reality</li>
            <li><strong>Demand resources</strong> — "We need more soldiers or the region falls"</li>
            <li><strong>Create crises</strong> — Provoke factions to justify larger military presence</li>
            <li><strong>Threaten withdrawal</strong> — "Recall me and the protectorate collapses"</li>
            <li><strong>Declare emergencies</strong> — Act unilaterally under guise of necessity</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Path to Power</h3>
        
        <p>Captain of the Crowns who seek the throne follow a recognizable pattern:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Build loyalty networks</strong> — Appoint trusted officers, reward soldiers personally</li>
            <li><strong>Secure a regional base</strong> — Make one territory deeply loyal to them, not Britain</li>
            <li><strong>Accumulate victories</strong> — Create reputation as the only competent leader</li>
            <li><strong>Engineer a crisis</strong> — Manufacture threat that requires their continued command</li>
            <li><strong>Refuse recall</strong> — Claim Britain's survival depends on their autonomy</li>
            <li><strong>March on the capital</strong> — Present coup as "temporary measure" for stability</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Historical Precedent: The General Who Became Emperor</strong>
            <p>Septimius Severus commanded Roman legions on the frontier. When the Emperor was assassinated, Severus marched on Rome with his loyal troops. He defeated rival claimants, disbanded the disloyal Praetorian Guard, and ruled for 18 years.</p>
            <p>His final advice to his sons: "Enrich the soldiers and scorn all others."</p>
            <p>Captain of the Crowns remember this lesson.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Multiple Captain of the Crowns: Division and Balance</h2>
        
        <p>Britain appoints up to three Captain of the Crowns to prevent any single one from dominating the military:</p>
        
        <h3>Benefits of Division</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No single Captain of the Crown controls all external forces</li>
            <li>Regional specialization prevents overwhelming individual power</li>
            <li>Captain of the Crowns compete for resources and favor</li>
            <li>If one defects, others can oppose them</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Risks of Division</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Captain of the Crowns may refuse to cooperate</li>
            <li>Regional rivalries weaken overall strategy</li>
            <li>During succession crises, Captain of the Crowns back different claimants</li>
            <li>If they all align, they control Britain's fate</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="quote-simple">
            Three Captain of the Crowns create redundancy.<br>
            Unless they agree. Then they create inevitability.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Interaction With Other Offices</h2>
        
        <h3>Captain of the Crowns and the Marshal of the Guard</h3>
        <p>The Marshal commands internal enforcement; Captain of the Crowns command external force. These roles do not overlap structurally but can align politically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>If aligned:</strong> Military and Guards present unified authority; regime becomes authoritarian</li>
            <li><strong>If opposed:</strong> Internal and external forces compete; regime becomes unstable</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Captains of the Crown and the Emissary of the Crown</h3>
        <p>Diplomacy and military force are supposed to complement each other. In practice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Diplomats claim Captain of the Crowns undermine negotiations with excessive violence</li>
            <li>Captain of the Crowns claim diplomats waste time while threats grow</li>
            <li>Each accuses the other of incompetence when strategies fail</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>A Captain of the Crown aligned with diplomacy in their region creates "controlled escalation." A Captain of the Crown ignoring diplomacy creates unwinnable conflicts.</p>
        
        <h3>Captain of the Crowns and the Crown</h3>
        <p>The King appoints the Lord of the Royal Army, who appoints Captain of the Crowns. This two-step separation creates plausible deniability:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a Captain of the Crown commits atrocities, the King can blame the Lord of the Royal Army</li>
            <li>If the Lord of the Royal Army recalls a popular Captain of the Crown, soldiers blame the Lord of the Royal Army, not the King</li>
            <li>If a Captain of the Crown defects, the King can claim they were "always unreliable"</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This distance protects the Crown but also weakens direct control.</p>
        
        <h2>Use of Force</h2>
        
        <p>Captain of the Crowns default to lethal force. Unlike City Guards who subdue and arrest, Captain of the Crowns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fight to destroy resistance</li>
            <li>Do not attempt to preserve enemies for trial</li>
            <li>Prioritize soldier survival over enemy lives</li>
            <li>Use overwhelming force to minimize casualties on their side</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Restraint (Exceptional)</h3>
        <p>Captain of the Crowns show restraint when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ordered explicitly to capture rather than kill</li>
            <li>Negotiating with a faction Britain intends to ally with later</li>
            <li>Demonstrating Britain's capacity for mercy to encourage surrender</li>
            <li>Civilian casualties would create political problems for the Crown</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This restraint is strategic calculation, not moral obligation.</p>
        
        <h2>Succession and Civil War</h2>
        
        <p>When the Crown is contested, Captain of the Crowns become kingmakers.</p>
        
        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Condition</th>
                <th>Outcome</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>All three Captain of the Crowns back the same claimant</td>
                <td>That claimant wins militarily</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Captain of the Crowns split between claimants</td>
                <td>Civil war becomes military stalemate</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Captain of the Crowns back different claimants than Guards</td>
                <td>Britain fractures into internal vs external factions</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>A Captain of the Crown declares themselves the rightful ruler</td>
                <td>Military coup; other commanders must respond</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h3>Why Captain of the Crowns Defect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>New claimant offers better terms (more autonomy, resources, land)</li>
            <li>Current regime seems doomed; backing a winner ensures survival</li>
            <li>Personal grievance with Crown or Lord of the Royal Army</li>
            <li>Regional loyalty stronger than loyalty to distant throne</li>
            <li>Genuine belief that current regime is illegitimate or incompetent</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Captain of the Crowns with long service, hardened veterans, and regional bases defect most successfully because they already operate quasi-independently.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Play This?</h2>
        
        <p>If Lord of the Royal Army is about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grand strategy</li>
            <li>Political danger</li>
            <li>Supreme command</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>And Soldiers are about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Combat</li>
            <li>Following orders</li>
            <li>Unit cohesion</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Captain of the Crowns are about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Regional autonomy</li>
            <li>Building power bases</li>
            <li>Tactical leadership</li>
            <li>Personal ambition</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Captain of the Crown players get:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Command authority over soldiers and officers</li>
            <li>Control of assigned regions and operations</li>
            <li>Autonomy in decision-making far from oversight</li>
            <li>Opportunity to build loyal veteran networks</li>
            <li>Path to political power through military success</li>
            <li>And the long-term temptation to stop answering to anyone</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>This is the role for players who want the power to act independently, the danger of ambition, and the possibility of becoming unstoppable.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        
        <ul>
