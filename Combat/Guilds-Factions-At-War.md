# ⚔️ Guilds & Factions at War
**Conflict of Interest as Game Engine**

---

## 📜 The Core Thesis
In Britannia, you can hold **Civic Seats** (e.g., King's Council) and **Guild Leadership** simultaneously. This creates a "Cold War" within the state. 

**Conflict is not a bug—it is the destination.**

---

## ⚔️ Mutual War Legitimacy

War is only legitimate when **both guilds declare war on each other**.

- **Mutual War**: Combat between the two guilds is treated as wartime conflict (not criminal by default).
- **One-Sided War**: If only one guild declares, **all attacks remain crimes** and produce normal criminal status.

This prevents predatory war declarations and preserves criminality as the boundary between sanctioned conflict and banditry.

## 🏛️ Tactical Realities

### 1. The Infiltrated Court
- **The Situation**: A Guild Leader sits on the King's Council.
- **The Play**: Use Civic Authority to leak rivals' warrants, sabotage trade deals, or block property auctions under the guise of "Civic Duty."

### 2. The Chain of Command Paradox
- **The Situation**: Your Faction goes to war with your Superior’s Faction.
- **The Choice**: Do you prioritize your [Institutional Role] (The Crown) or your [Guild Blood]? 
- **The Result**: Betrayal of the Crown leads to [Exile]; betrayal of the Guild leads to internal assassination.

### 3. Negotiable Justice
- **The Situation**: A guildmate is arrested by a rival who holds the [Marshal] seat.
- **The Play**: Use your political leverage to secure [Royal Clemency] or "lose" the evidence in the [Property Ledger].

## 👑 The King's Balancing Act
A successful Monarch must manage these tensions, not eliminate them:
- **Balance Factions**: Staff the court with rivals to prevent any single group from becoming too powerful to control.
- **The Purge Risk**: Kicking out all rivals leaves the city without competent administrators and essentially "invites" a coup.
- **Legacy of Sabotage**: Every decision made by a factional court member is a move on the global chess board.

## ⚖️ Practical Outcomes

| Entity | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Players** | Powerful but vulnerable. Every choice creates permanent enemies. |
| **Kings** | Must trade land/roles for peace or rule through a constant purge. |
| **Guilds** | View Civic Seats as strategic assets for "Infiltration" and "Weaponized Law." |

> [!TIP]
> **Historical Parallel: Wars of the Roses**
> Richard, Duke of York served as **Lord Protector** while actively plotting to take the throne. The government was staffed by people who hated each other, turning every meeting into a cold war.
