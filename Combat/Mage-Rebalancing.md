# Mage Rebalancing: Casting Risk & Commitment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Design North Star**
> * **Mages dominate when uncontested.**
> * **Fighters dominate once they apply pressure.**

THESE ARE JUST IDEAS AND NOT OFFICIAL CHANGES.

## 1. Casting Risk & Commitment
* **Interrupts**: Any damage interrupts casting and consumes mana (no refunds).
* **Immobility**: Casting roots or heavily slows movement for the cast duration.
* **Potion Lockout**: Casting disables potion use until the spell resolves.
* **Pressure Tax**: Casting within melee range increases cast time.
* **Exposure Window**: Taking damage during casting increases incoming damage briefly (counter-burst vulnerability).

## 2. Mana, Sustain & Reset Prevention
* **In-Combat Regeneration**: Sharply reduced to prevent infinite kiting.
* **Meditation**: Requires immobility and breaks immediately on hit.
* **Potion Dampening**: Recent damage reduces potion effectiveness (anti-kite sustain).
* **Fizzle Penalty**: Spell fizzles consume full mana and apply a short global cooldown.
* **Shared Cooldowns**: Mana potions share a longer cooldown with healing potions.

## 3. Crowd Control (CC) Overhaul
* **Diminishing Returns (DR)**: Repeated application of Paralyze, Sleep, or Freeze has reduced effect.
* **Immunity**: Short CC immunity window after control ends.
* **Armor Scaling**: CC duration scales down with target's armor weight (incentivizing heavier armor for frontline).
* **Cost Scaling**: Repeated CC casts increase mana cost exponentially.
* **Break on Damage**: CC breaks early if the target takes sufficient melee damage.

## 4. Armor, Loadout & Hybrid Penalties
* **Heavy Armor**: Increases cast time and mana cost.
* **Shields**: Reduce spell accuracy or significantly increase fizzle chance.
* **Mitigation**: Armor provides partial spell mitigation (spells do not fully bypass armor).

## 5. Fighter-Centric Counterplay
* **Disruption**: Melee hits have a reliable chance to disrupt or silence casting.
* **Gap Closers**: Mechanics/Items to instantly break casting and prevent recast briefly.

## Implementation Strategy: Minimum Viable Rebalance (Top 5)
1. **Interrupts Consume Mana**: Immediately punishes bad positioning.
2. **Pressure Tax**: Increases cast time in melee, giving Fighters a clear window.
3. **CC Diminishing Returns**: Prevents infinite lockdown, crucial for PvP health.
4. **Armor Mitigation**: Ensures armor has value against magic.
5. **Meditation Break on Hit**: Stops combat resets.

## Strategic Context: Permadeath & Interregnum
* **High Stakes Positioning**: The "Exposure Window" and root-on-cast mechanics make solo magery extremely dangerous in a Permadeath environment. Mages must rely on frontliners.
* **Group Synergy**: Interregnum group PvP becomes distinct—Fighters protect the "Artillery" (Mages). If the line breaks, the Mages fall.
* **No Escape**: Reduced sustain and anti-kite potion mechanics ensure that once caught, a Mage cannot simply out-heal a Fighter's damage output.
