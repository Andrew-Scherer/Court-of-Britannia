# 🥊 Dueling Pits
**Closed Combat Arenas with Controlled Rules**

---

## 📜 Core Purpose
Dueling pits provide a safe, contained space for consensual combat without criminal consequences. They are designed for rivalry, training, and spectacle — not for generating criminal status.

---

## ⚖️ Rules Inside the Pit
While inside the dueling pit, the following rules apply:

1. **No Crimes Count**
   - Combat inside the pit never generates **Grey** or **Red** status.
   - Both players are treated as legal targets for each other.

2. **Short Knockdown Timer**
   - When a player is knocked down, their timer is reduced to **10 seconds**.

3. **Full Health on Wake**
   - Upon standing, the player’s health is fully restored.

4. **Two-Player Limit**
   - Only **two players** may enter a duel at a time.
   - Entry is through **two dedicated tiles** that immediately teleport them into the pit.

5. **Automatic Exit on Finish**
   - When the duel ends, **both players are teleported out** of the arena.

## ✅ Design Intent
- Enables skill-based rivalry without criminalization.
- Allows spectatorship and repeat duels without long downtime.
- Prevents exploitation by limiting entry and enforcing controlled resets.
