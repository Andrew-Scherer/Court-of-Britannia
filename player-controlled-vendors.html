        <h2>The Core Rule</h2>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <strong>Only guild and faction members have the ability to place and control their own vendors.</strong>
            <p>Vendors must be placed inside or directly outside faction/guild controlled buildings.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>If you want to be a dedicated crafter, merchant, or trader who directly participates in the game's crafting and trade economy, <strong>you must align yourself with a faction or guild</strong>. You cannot run your craft independently.</p>
        
        <h2>Why This System Exists</h2>
        
        <div class="quote">
            Traditionally, this is exactly how crafters and merchants worked in medieval times.
        </div>
        
        <p>Throughout the medieval period and for a large portion of human history, <strong>guilds controlled crafting in a massive way</strong>. Guilds didn't just regulate quality or prices — they controlled <strong>who could legally make things</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Blacksmiths, weavers, bakers, cobblers, and every other craft existed within guild structures. Independent craftsmen were often barred from selling in cities, prosecuted for practicing trades without guild membership, or forced to work under guild masters until they earned full membership themselves.</p>
        
        <p>This system recreates that dynamic: <strong>craft power flows through organizations, not individuals.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>How Player Vendors Work</h2>
        
        <h3>Placement Requirements</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You must be a member of a <strong>guild</strong> or <strong>faction</strong></li>
            <li>The guild/faction must control property (a building with a placed guildstone)</li>
            <li>Vendors can only be placed <strong>inside</strong> or <strong>directly outside</strong> guild/faction controlled buildings</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Vendor Control</h3>
        <p>As a guild or faction member, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Place your own vendor at approved guild/faction locations</li>
            <li>Stock the vendor with your crafted goods or traded items</li>
            <li>Set prices for items on your vendor</li>
            <li>Collect revenue from sales (minus guild/faction taxes)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Guild & Faction Sales Taxes</h2>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Direct Revenue Stream</h3>
            <p>Player vendor sales <strong>directly influence guild and faction coffers</strong> through the collection of sales taxes.</p>
            <p>Guild and faction leaders can <strong>set the tax percentage</strong> collected on all vendor sales through the Guild/Faction Leader gump.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>How Taxes Work</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Step</th>
                <th>What Happens</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>1. Customer Purchase</strong></td>
                <td>A player buys an item from your vendor for 100 gold</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>2. Tax Collection</strong></td>
                <td>Guild/faction automatically collects their set tax % (e.g., 10% = 10 gold)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>3. Vendor Owner Payment</strong></td>
                <td>You receive the remaining gold (90 gold in this example)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>4. Guild/Faction Treasury</strong></td>
                <td>The tax goes directly into the guild/faction coffers</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h3>Tax Rate Flexibility</h3>
        <p>Guild and faction leaders can adjust tax rates to balance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Revenue generation:</strong> Higher taxes = more guild/faction income</li>
            <li><strong>Crafter attraction:</strong> Lower taxes = more appealing to merchants and crafters</li>
            <li><strong>Competitive advantage:</strong> Guilds compete for crafter membership through favorable rates</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>⚠️ Economic Warfare:</strong> A guild that taxes vendors at 50% may fund massive military campaigns but struggle to attract crafters. A guild that taxes at 5% may become a merchant haven but lack funds for defense. Leaders must balance economic policy with organizational needs.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Why Guilds & Factions Want Crafters</h2>
        
        <p>Guilds and factions have <strong>powerful incentives</strong> to attract crafters and merchants into their fold:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Direct Revenue</h3>
        <p>Every vendor sale generates tax income. A thriving marketplace means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Steady gold flow into guild/faction coffers</li>
            <li>Ability to fund upkeep costs (for factions)</li>
            <li>Resources for military campaigns, property expansion, or political maneuvering</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2. Economic Power</h3>
        <p>Crafters provide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weapons and armor for guild/faction members</li>
            <li>Self-sufficiency (no need to buy from rivals)</li>
            <li>Economic leverage (control supply of critical goods)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. Political Influence</h3>
        <p>A guild or faction with a monopoly on certain crafts can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set market prices</li>
            <li>Embargo rivals</li>
            <li>Leverage essential goods for political concessions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4. Population Growth</h3>
        <p>Crafters attract customers. Customers create:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Foot traffic to guild/faction territory</li>
            <li>Opportunities for recruitment</li>
            <li>Visible signs of organizational health and prosperity</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Incentives to Encourage Trade & Commerce</h2>
        
        <div class="quote-simple">
            <strong>Guilds and factions that encourage trade prosper. Those that don't, wither.</strong>
        </div>
        
        <p>Since vendor taxes directly fund guild and faction operations, leaders have strong incentives to:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protect trade routes:</strong> Safe passage = more customers = more sales = more taxes</li>
            <li><strong>Host markets and festivals:</strong> Events drive traffic and vendor sales</li>
            <li><strong>Recruit skilled crafters:</strong> Better goods = higher prices = more tax revenue</li>
            <li><strong>Lower tax rates strategically:</strong> Attract crafters away from rival organizations</li>
            <li><strong>Build reputation:</strong> Known marketplaces become destinations</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This creates an economic ecosystem where guilds and factions compete not just militarily, but <strong>economically and politically</strong> through commerce.</p>
        
        <h2>No Independent Crafters</h2>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Critical Rule:</strong> You cannot place vendors independently. If you want to participate in the crafting and trade economy as a vendor owner, you <strong>must join a guild or faction</strong>.
        </div>
        
        <h3>Why This Rule Matters</h3>
        <p>Preventing independent vendors creates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Organizational dependency:</strong> Crafters need guilds; guilds need crafters</li>
            <li><strong>Economic competition:</strong> Guilds compete for crafter talent through favorable policies</li>
            <li><strong>Political entanglement:</strong> Your craft ties you to your organization's conflicts</li>
            <li><strong>Collective identity:</strong> Crafts become associated with guilds ("Crimson Vanguard steel is the best")</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Gameplay Consequences</h3>
        <p>This system forces meaningful choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do you join the powerful guild with high taxes or the struggling guild with low taxes?</li>
            <li>Do you pledge to a faction aligned with Britain or an outlaw faction?</li>
            <li>Do you stay loyal when your guild goes to war, risking your vendor's safety?</li>
            <li>Do you defect to a rival guild when offered better terms?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Historical Parallels</h2>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Medieval Guild Control</h3>
            <p>In medieval cities, guilds didn't just regulate—they <strong>monopolized</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>London guilds:</strong> Controlled who could sell goods in the city; independent merchants were fined or banished</li>
                <li><strong>Florentine guilds:</strong> The Arte della Lana (wool guild) became so powerful it influenced elections and foreign policy</li>
                <li><strong>German guilds:</strong> Required years of apprenticeship followed by journeyman work before full membership</li>
                <li><strong>Hanseatic League:</strong> A guild confederation that operated its own navy and negotiated treaties like a nation</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>Guilds weren't just economic organizations—they were <strong>political and military entities</strong> that controlled entire cities and regions.</p>
        
        <h2>Example Scenarios</h2>
        
        <h3>Scenario 1: The Blacksmith's Dilemma</h3>
        <p>You're a master blacksmith who wants to sell legendary weapons. You have two options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Join the Iron Brotherhood (guild):</strong> 15% tax, Britain-aligned, safe but regulated</li>
            <li><strong>Join the Shadowfen Marauders (faction):</strong> 5% tax, outlaw faction, dangerous but profitable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your choice determines not just your revenue, but your political allegiances, customer base, and survival risks.</p>
        
        <h3>Scenario 2: The Guild War</h3>
        <p>Your guild goes to war with a rival. Enemy forces raid your guild hall and destroy vendors. Now you must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay loyal and rebuild (lose income, show solidarity)</li>
            <li>Defect to a safer guild (save your business, be branded a traitor)</li>
            <li>Negotiate with the enemy (preserve your vendor, betray your guild)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Scenario 3: The Tax Revolt</h3>
        <p>Your guild leader raises vendor taxes from 10% to 30% to fund a military campaign. Crafters threaten to defect to a rival guild. The leader must choose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lower taxes (keep crafters happy, lose war funding)</li>
            <li>Maintain taxes (fund the war, lose crafters and revenue)</li>
            <li>Negotiate (partial tax for members who contribute militarily)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Only guild and faction members can place and control player vendors</li>
            <li>Vendors must be placed inside or directly outside guild/faction controlled buildings</li>
            <li>Guilds and factions collect sales taxes on all vendor transactions</li>
            <li>Tax rates are set by guild/faction leaders, creating economic policy choices</li>
            <li>Guilds and factions have strong incentives to attract crafters and encourage commerce</li>
            <li>There are no independent crafters—you must align with an organization to participate in vendor-based trade</li>
            <li>This system creates economic competition, political entanglement, and meaningful organizational loyalty</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="quote">
            Your craft is not just your livelihood—it is your political identity, your economic allegiance, and your survival tied to the fate of your guild or faction.
