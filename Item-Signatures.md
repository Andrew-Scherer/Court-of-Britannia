# 🛠️ Item Signatures

**Crafting Identity and Accountability**

---


## The Core Rule


> Only items of consequence remember their maker.Exceptional craft leaves a name behind.

We're implementing a selective item signature system that transforms crafting from anonymous production into visible, political, and consequential economic activity.


## Items That Record Crafters

**Exceptional quality items automatically record the crafter's name.**

Why exceptional items?


- Exceptional is already a skill check
- Exceptional implies pride of workmanship
- Exceptional items circulate longer
- Exceptional items create reputations

This mirrors history perfectly: masterwork pieces bore names; mass goods did not.


### Example


> **Note**
> *Exceptional Steel Longsword*  
> 
>             Crafted by **Edric of Britain**

That's enough. No stats spam. No lore dump. Just attribution.


## Why Not Stamp Everything?

Because over-stamping kills meaning.

If *every* dagger has a name:


- Players stop reading it
- Reputation blurs
- Noise replaces signal

You want players to **recognize names**, not ignore them.

Scarcity creates memory.


## Craft Identity as Risk

Signed items create **exposure**.

If an execution blade is traced back to a smith:


- That smith becomes politically implicated
- Refusal to craft becomes meaningful
- Black-market work becomes dangerous


> **✅ Note**

This creates meaningful choices about what to craft, for whom, and whether to sign it.


## Crafter Control: Opt-Out With Cost

Give crafters **agency** over signatures.


### Suggested Defaults


- **Exceptional items** → auto-signed
- **Shop-sold items** → shop mark added (see [[Player Shops|Player-Shops]])
- **Crafter may opt out** of signature at crafting time


### Opt-Out Costs

Choosing anonymity has consequences:


- Reduced resale value
- Loss of "exceptional" quality tag
- Reputation penalty if the unsigned work is discovered


> **❗ Note**


## Commissioned Items

When a player commissions an item directly:


- Both names appear (crafter and patron)
- Or the buyer's name appears as patron


### Example


> **Note**
> *Exceptional Executioner's Axe*  
> 
>             Crafted by **Harrow Blacksmith**  
> 
>             Commissioned by **The Crown of Britain**

That object is now **historical**.

If it shows up later in unexpected hands, investigators care. The story continues.


## Why This Matters

Item signatures are not cosmetic flourish. They are **memory**.

In a world where:


- Characters die permanently
- Political allegiances shift
- Power changes hands
- Records track everything

...the objects that persist become evidence of history.

A blade forged by a known smith, commissioned by a fallen lord, carried through multiple owners, wielded in an assassination — that's not just gear.

That's a story.
